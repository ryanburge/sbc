"1","	RESOLVED, That we, the members of the Southern Baptist Convention, reassert our truceless and uncompromising hostility to the manufacture, sale, importation and transportation, of alcoholic beverages in any and all their forms.  We regard the policy of issuing government licenses for the purpose of carrying on the liquor traffic as a sin against God and a dishonor to our people.  We furthermore announce it as our conviction that we should by all legitimate means oppose the liquor traffic in municipality, county, State, and nation.	Furthermore, we announce it as the sense of this body that no person should be retained in the fellowship of a Baptist church who engages in the manufacture or sale of alcoholic liquors, either at wholesale or retail, who invests his money in the manufacture or sale of alcoholic liquors, or who rents his property to be used for distilleries, wholesale liquor houses, or saloons.  Nor do we believe that any church should retain in its fellowship any member who drinks intoxicating liquors as a beverage, or visits saloons or drinking places for the purpose of such indulgence.",1896

"5","The committee to whom was referred the communication from the Mission Board of the North Pacific Coast Convention beg leave to report:	1.  The communication contains an appeal to the Convention to interfere by mediation and otherwise in a strife that has arisen between brethren of different views of church policy and action, which strife affects the missionary plans and policies of the American Baptist Home Mission Society in a territory in which this Convention has never had any missions.	2.  On inquiry we find that though the North Pacific Coast Convention has contributed some money to the mission work of this Convention, it has not done so in such amount or manner as to entitle it to representation in the body and so it cannot claim our action on the ground of being a part of the Convention, or its work being a part of the Convention's work.	3.  Apart from this consideration, we do not deem it within the province of this Convention to in any manner interfere in the local contentions as to doctrine and policy of other Baptist bodies, whether connected with it originally or not.	We recommend that the Convention respectfully decline the request of the North Pacific Coast Convention, while at the same time we extend to them our loving sympathy in their struggle for what they believe to be right and truth, and pray for them and those with whom they contend, that the Spirit of God may lead them all into peace and harmony with the truth.

"36","The resolutions sent up by the Georgia Convention give in emphatic and succinct terms the views of that body on this important subject, but are so framed as not to be adapted for direct action by this Convention, and complying with the suggestion of the Georgia Convention, your Committee deem it appropriate that resolutions be specially framed and submitted for action by this body as follows:	God speed the day that, when by suggestions like those we here submit, or by better ones, if any can make them, men and women and girl children, and all the innocent and the good, may be safe as they come and go, and in their homes, whether such homes be in castle or cabin!	The law is very weak and imperfect.  ""We speak this to our shame.""  But lynching is not the remedy.  Lynching blunts the public conscience, undermines the foundations on which society stands, and if unchecked will bring on anarchy.	We should not stop with merely writing and teaching and praying against the lynchers, leaving the helpless and innocent victims of crime with no adequate or sufficient protection.  Our condemnation is due with equal emphasis, and in many cases with much greater emphasis, against the horrible crimes which cause the lynchings.	President Roosevelt, in a public address delivered at Little Rock, Ark., in October of last year, as reported at the time in the public press, amongst other things said:	""We urgently need in this country methods for expediting punishment--methods for doing away with delay, methods which will secure to the public an even chance with the criminal.  At the present the right of appeals is in criminal cases so abused as to make it a matter of the utmost difficulty ultimately to punish a man sufficiently rich or sufficiently influential to command really good legal talent.	""If the law is reasonably speedy and reasonably sure, it takes away one great excuse for lawlessness.  If some horrible crime is committed, and the people feel that under the best circumstances there will be an indefinite delay in the punishment of the criminal, and that the punishment will be uncertain, even when the time for administration of it comes, then a premium is put on that kind of law breaking which more than other is a menace to the law.	""I earnestly hope that some substantial improvement shall be made in the direction of securing greater expedition and greater certainty in the administration of justice, especially in the administration of criminal justice.""	Let it be observed that the complaint here is not in regard to what the law declares to be crime or in the punishment which the law denounces against crimes, but the difficulty lies in the remedies given in legal administration for the enforcement of the law; the trouble being, not as to what the law is, but as to carrying it into effect.	The daily papers are teeming with accounts of horrible tragedies and crimes, and they seem to be growing worse and more numerous.  The law as now contrived, in the hands of offenders of all classes, offenders and defenders, who know how to use or misuse the law, is but a poor protection and dependence for the innocent and the good.	The evils above named and the remedies needed are confined to no part of the United States, but crimes and lynchings have become so general and so frequent in nearly all parts of our common country as to form an appalling aggregate--enough to make any Christian shudder or sadden the heart of a patriot.	But what shall we do about it?  The answer is:  Make the law better and make it stronger.  Amend the law.  Give it more promptness and more wisdom and more justice and more certainty in its own enforcement.  Astonish the murderer and rapist by its quickness and its certainty.  If the law will protect the innocent and the good in all the States, the innocent and the good in all the States will respect the law.  Enlarge the powers of the courts.  Take away the unreasonable provisions by which so many advantages are given to the criminal in the trials.  Give the State the right of appeal or to have a writ of error just like the criminal has, and in every criminal trial put the State and the accused upon terms of perfect equality, so that innocent and good people may rely on the law for protection rather than rush into irregular and dangerous force under methods of their own.	Your Committee are well aware that this Convention has no ecclesiastical jurisdiction, but it is recommended that all our membership guided by Bible precept, and with prayers for the blessing of Almighty God, agitate for and insist on amendments in the criminal laws and judicial procedure until all men know that the courts will surely visit just and speedy punishment upon the guilty in every case.	It is hoped that the discussion of this important subject may be taken up and continued by the different State conventions and district associations until combined public sentiment shall demand and obtain the needed and appropriate remedies and amendments of the kind indicated.

"44","	WHEREAS, One of the very greatest obstacles in the way of the advancement of God's kingdom in the world, both at home and abroad, is the legalized liquor traffic, ruining homes, blighting characters, blasting lives, damning souls, and neutralizing to a large extent the work of pastors and missionaries on home and foreign fields.

(2)  That we reaffirm our faith in the righteousness of the Sermon on the Mount, and our confidence and infallible wisdom of him who has taught us to love our enemies, to bless them that curse us, and to do good to them that despitefully use and persecute us.	(3)  That we desire a stronger faith in the God who maketh wars to cease even unto the ends of the earth, and we shall rejoice if our own people, and all of every name who love the Lord Jesus Christ, in sincerity, shall find it in their hearts to pray for kings and for all that are in authority that we may live quiet and peaceable lives in all godliness and honesty.",1917
"90","The Southern Baptist Convention, assembled in the city of New Orleans, May 19, 1917, representing the views commonly held by the Baptists everywhere, contemplating with mingled feelings of sorrow and hope the conflict of the great nations, which we recognize as a struggle of militarism, autocracy and special privilege against the simple fundamental, indefeasible and inalienable human rights, goes to record before the world as follows:	Reaffirming the immemorial position of Baptists, we insist that the preaching of the gospel or any other form of religious belief should, of right, be free around the whole world, and the right to profess and to practice any or no religion is not to be brought into question by Tsar, Kaiser, Potentate, Ecclesiastical Council or any other human authority, whatever; therefore,	We hold unwaveringly to the belief that in the army camps preaching should be free to all alike--Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Baptists--subject only to such limitations as the exigencies of military order may require.	Contemplating the titanic struggle of humanity for individualism in state and in religion, we are moved by conflicting emotions of profound sorrow, and high hope; sorrow for the manifold griefs of the warring people, Teutonic, Saxon, Latin, our brothers all, and over against this, high hope for the emancipation, for which creation has groaned through weary centuries.  We insist that in the reconstruction of modern civilization now going on that the President of the United States and his counsellors, whom Providence has thrust into the leadership of advancing civilization shall, in the final adjustment of the issues involved, see to it that everywhere religious persecutions shall cease, that preaching and the exercise of religion shall be free to every responsible human soul.",1917

That the student render a specified amount of work each week in connection with the churches, Sunday schools, and mission stations of the community, or any other such forms as may be suggested.  From three to five hours per week would, perhaps, be the proper amount the time to be given to this work by the individual student.	2.  That the student return the loan, without interest, after he has finished his college and seminary work.  This may be done either as a personal gift or in the form of money raised from others for the purpose.	RESOLVED, Second, that this recommendation is in no way to be understood as setting aside other gift funds or loan funds now being administered by our colleges and seminaries.  These have been useful in the past and will no doubt continue to be useful in the future.  The present recommendation seeks to add to them a method of aid which will promote the spread of the kingdom in the communities where our schools are located, in the form suggested in this resolution.",1917

"133","To President Calvin Coolidge and Secretary of State, Chas. E. Hughes, Washington, D.C.	More than five thousand Baptists, in Convention assembled, respectfully bring to your attention the denial of religious liberty to many thousands of people of our faith, as well as to many other Christians, on the part of the present Russian and Rumanian governments.  In both these countries our country, with some measure of generosity, has ministered to the physical wants of multitudes of people in recent years and is still doing so, and we express the hope that our government, which has ever stood for full religious liberty to all peoples, of every faith, may be able to exert such an influence upon the governments of Russia and of Rumania as to bring about a better condition as suggested herein.	RESOLUTION ON RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION IN RUMANIA	WHEREAS, We the representatives of the Baptists of the Southern States of the United States of America, assembled in annual Convention in the City of Atlanta, Georgia, numbering more than five thousand delegates, representing more than three million communicants and a citizenship of more than fifteen million, have learned with pain and deep concern of the continuance and extension of the persecution of our Baptist brethren in Rumania; and	WHEREAS, We have learned upon indisputable testimony that Baptist men, women, and children have suffered great hardships in the form of personal indignities and violence, being publicly ridiculed, fined, arrested, imprisoned, whipped, severely beaten, sometimes into unconsciousness, and suffering many similar painful and humiliating experiences; and	WHEREAS, Baptist children have been refused promotion in schools and have frequently been expelled on account of their faith or that of their parents; and	WHEREAS, In certain districts marriage licenses have been refused to Baptist young people, thus preventing the solemnizing of marriage; and	WHEREAS, The burial of Baptists in cemeteries has been forbidden, making it necessary to deposit the bodies in ground set apart for the burial of animals; and	WHEREAS, In addition to these personal indignities and sufferings which are constantly and apparently growing worse, the churches are greatly hampered and distressed in their work by severely restrictive regulations, by which while worship is allowed the propagation of our faith is forbidden, and hindered in every possible way; worship can be held only in registered and licensed buildings, only Rumania citizens are permitted to preach, and then only in one place thus greatly hindering missionary activities; the churches are required to state the sources of all their funds, and are not allowed to receive aid from abroad; and	WHEREAS, The execution of these restrictive measures are much more severe than the letter of the law, threatening to stop all Baptist growth; in numerous districts the churches have been forcibly closed and the congregation expelled, Bibles have been burned and their distribution forbidden, while the preachers and leaders have been severely mishandled and frequently imprisoned.  In short the situation as authentically reported to us has become so distressing as to call for our deepest sympathy and our active assistance.	Therefore  Be It RESOLVED, That we regard such an infringement of the fundamental and inalienable rights of humanity as violative of the dearest treasures of modern civilization, such as has not existed elsewhere upon the continent of Europe for many decades, and not in England since the reign of Charles II.  It is the revival of mediaevalism in what purports to be a modern state, a state which is proud to be associated with other states where the rights of conscience are recognized as inviolate, and religious freedom is a part of the supreme law of the land.	Under these circumstances we feel constrained to call upon the people and Government of Rumania to grant and guarantee to their fellow Rumanians of the Baptist faith those fundamental rights of conscience which are the crowning glory of the modern world.  We appeal to them in the name of humanity, in the name of modern ideals, in the name of religion and righteousness, in the name of fundamental human rights, to put an end to the persecutions of our Baptist brethren in Rumania.  Nothing is more futile than persecution, and nothing is more abhorrent to New Testament principle and alien to the modern ideals than the denial of religious freedom.  Baptists have ever been noted for their loyalty to Government, their obedience to law, their love of peace and good order, their devotion to liberty and progress.  We believe that Rumania now has no more faithful citizens, no more stable and dependable element of population than the Baptists of Rumania.  In the name, therefore, of national friendship and good will we appeal to the people and Government of Rumania to grant to our Baptist people the rights of conscience and the freedom of religion.	Resolved further that the President and Secretaries of this Convention be instructed to transmit in such manner as may seem most expedient, to the people and Government of Rumania these Resolutions.",1924

"164","We, the members of the Southern Baptist Convention, assembled in Birmingham, Alabama, May 13-17, 1931, representing four million white Baptists of the Southern States of the United States of America, desire to set forth and proclaim the following pronouncement concerning persecution by the Russian Soviet government of the various religious communions on account of their religious opinions.	First, we hold that religion is primarily a matter of the relation of the individual soul to his Creator.  Therefore, the approach of the soul to God must, of necessity, be voluntary and untrammeled.  One cannot act for another because one does not know another's conscience and cannot bear another's responsibility.  If it be said by the Soviet government, or others, that there is no God, our reply is that such declaration does violence to the self-consciousness of the human mind and heart which abundantly testifies to the human spirit that there is a supreme being, the Creator of the universe and all things therein, and that men are responsible to him for their conduct.	No earthly government has any right to require its citizens, or subjects, to be religious, or to estop them from religious convictions and activities.  Any effort to do so is the essence of oppression and tyranny.  Religious freedom is a right, not a grant.  It is the gift of God, not a concession from men.  It is a law of life, and not an enactment of human statutes.	In the second place, we contend that the verdict of history, experience, and observation certifies that religion does not imperil but greatly improves citizenship.  It is altogether false and slanderous to say that one's loyalty to conscience and to God renders him a disloyal or undesirable citizen.  There cannot be the most intelligent and capable citizenship without freedom of conscience and mind for the expression of individual character.  Any effort to repress his individual free spirit is a blow at the very source of life.  Such an attempt is inimical to human progress, subversive to the rights of conscience and hopelessly vain, and futile because it contravenes the law of God and denies the deepest needs of the soul.	We are not concerned with the particular form of civil government which any state may see fit to adopt, provided only that the government shall not claim the right to dominate the spirit, or determine its attitude on religious and moral questions.  The true purpose of government is to protect the citizen in his natural and spiritual rights, to further his development and not to exploit him.  The state has no religious function and, therefore, the state has no authority over the individual citizen in such matters, and the claim of such is usurpation, oppression, tyranny, toward the citizen, and irreverence, insult and well-nigh blasphemy toward God.	Third, we hold that the Russian Soviet Government in its persecution of religion, as expressed in the closing of churches, discrimination against ministers of religion and their families, punishment and imprisonment and exile of religious teachers, the suppression of religious literature, and the limitation of free speech and of the freedom of assembly and the support of anti-religious teaching in the state schools, is not only violating the inherent rights of humanity but is hindering its own national development and endangering its safety and solidarity as a nation.	In good friendship toward all the Russian people we bear this testimony to the Soviet government because necessity is upon us:  because fundamental human rights have been invaded, and the conscience of men outraged; because persecution for conscience sake is an anachronism in this day of intelligence and progress:  because such a course on the part of any government brings it into reproach in the family of nations, and lifts up an insurmountable barrier to the normal development of its own citizens.  When men are oppressed and wronged for performing their conscientious duties to God it becomes a matter of concern to all the world.  Liberty-loving citizens throughout the earth are shocked and grieved to hear that people are sorely persecuted in Russia on account of their religious opinions.  Conscience has a right to speak.  Justice must have a voice.	We appeal to the Soviet government in the name of reason, justice, conscience, humanity and God Almighty, that she fully recognize and cheerfully accord to all her citizens and subjects the indefeasible rights of conscience in all matters of religion.

The Committee is also requested to express to President Roosevelt our cordial support of his noble appeal to the rulers of all nations to maintain peace and to frown upon aggression on the part of any nation against another nation.	The Committee is instructed to inform our President that we deplore the return of the legalized sale of beer and wine and that we would regard the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment as a calamity to our nation.  We believe that Prohibition at its worst is better than the legalized sale of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes at its best.

"173","""For the past three years the Southern Baptist Convention has recognized Arizona as part of its territory.  In 1870, the state of Arizona was entered by the American Baptist Home Mission Society of the Northern Baptist Convention, which organization has occupied the field ever since.  During all these years the Society has maintained a faithful Baptist testimony, established and maintained churches in strategic centers, and has invested thousands of dollars in salaries, in church buildings, and in equipment.	""The recognition of Arizona as a field of endeavor for Southern Baptists has challenged the aforementioned activities, and has brought to pass by its occupation of the state conditions wholly unfavorable to Baptist work.  Division of some churches has taken place because the spirit of sectionalism, and strife has been engendered.  In view of these things, it is suggested that the Convention's relationship to Arizona work be recanvassed and reconsidered, and that the Southern Baptist Convention be asked to determine a definite policy as touching territory already occupied by the Northern Baptist Convention.	""Whereas, a mutual understanding is supposed to exist between the Northern and Southern conventions as to allocation of territory, and	""Whereas, Christian fellowship exists between the two national bodies in the exchange of fraternal delegates, and in membership in the Baptist World Alliance; and	""Whereas, an overlapping of convention interests exists in the state, bringing about a duplication of effort and a waste of money; and	""WHEREAS, every Baptist church in Arizona in affiliation with the Northern Baptist Convention is Baptistically sound and loyal to the faith once for all delivered; and	""WHEREAS, The American Baptist Home Mission Society has been at work in this state for fifty years and has always in its long history recognized territory occupied by the Southern Baptist Convention, therefore, be it	""RESOLVED, that a memorial be prepared by the executive committee of the Arizona Baptist Convention to present to the executive committee of the Southern Baptist Convention, calling for the appointment of a special committee for the purpose of reconsidering the Southern Baptists' relationship to the state and its work.  It is hoped that by the work of such a committee such action will be taken as to promote a better understanding between the two great national conventions.  It ought to be plainly understood by all that there is no more scriptural or moral or ethical reason why Southern Baptists should be at work in this state than there is that Northern Baptists should be at work in territory already occupied by them.""

That our pastors, Sunday school teachers, editors, the Sunday School Board and writers in the Baptist papers are to be commended most warmly for their persistent teachings and efforts during the past year warning against the evil and destructive effects of all alcoholic beverages, and seeking to save our civilization from becoming utterly liquor soaked and morally sodden.	4.  That we urge all of the persons and agencies mentioned above to continue the good fight.  Our civilization must not be sacrificed to drunkenness and debauchery through strong drink.	5.  That we frankly and unhesitatingly deplore and condemn as utterly inexcusable and wicked the present policy of government, both the national government and the government of nearly all of the states, by which the government not only licenses the sale of liquor but actually and actively sponsors and seeks to promote its sale and consumption.	6.  That we particularly condemn the lax and bungling laws that have been enacted ostensibly to control liquor, but actually to provide for its manufacture, distribution, sale and consumption almost without control, regulation or restriction.	7.  That until we can secure the return and the firm re-establishment of prohibition, both State and National, which is our goal and for which we will constantly strive, we use all diligence to secure the enactment of much needed regulatory and restrictive measures, such as will place beer where it belongs as a dangerous, deadening and destructive alcoholic liquor, remove the sale of beer and all other intoxicating liquors from filling stations, drug stores and restaurants, and confine the sale of all intoxicants to places devoted exclusively to their sale so that sales can be properly regulated and policed; so that the badge of respectability now sought to be placed upon liquor may be made impossible and that liquor may be branded as it deserves to be as the chief source of vice, crime, poverty and degradation, and so that at least the women and youth may not be engulfed in the rising tide of drunkenness.	8.  That we condemn the widespread campaign of advertising carried on by the liquor traffic both through the public press and to some extent over the radio.  We do not believe that newspapers, which are so heavily subsidized by the government on the theory that they are to be advocates of liberty and good citizenship, have any moral right to receive blood money from the liquor traffic for their advertising columns, which of necessity must influence more or less their editorial policies.  It is hardly right or consistent for us to boast of the freedom of the press, so far as governmental censorship is concerned, while the press goes into bondage to a corrupt and blighting business.	9.

"208","This year of grace, 1936, marks the one-hundredth anniversary of the death of the greatest American Baptist in all the history of our denomination--the illustrious Luther Rice.  The Baptists at the nation's capital are having a special recognition of this significant event, and one of our distinguished educators, and men of letters, is writing a new biography of the great denominational leader and statesman which will call fresh attention to the immortal labors, and the incomparable achievements of this man to whom American Baptists owe an obligation that can never be adequately discharged.	Moreover, within less than another decade we shall be observing the one-hundredth anniversary of the organization of the Southern Baptist Convention at Augusta, Georgia, in 1845.  Not very far away in Saluda County, South Carolina, repose the ashes of Luther Rice, the seer of visions, the doer of mighty tasks, who led the Baptists out of a wilderness into a cooperative fellowship, fired them with evangelistic and missionary zeal and passion, laid the foundations of our missionary organization, of our system of schools and colleges, of our publishing houses and denominational journals, and of practically every item in our present set-up by means of which, under God, we have grown from an obscure and uninfluential group to the largest evangelical body in our western world.  Surely one of the high points in that epochal anniversary of 1845 will be a Baptist pilgrimage to the obscure resting place of this prophet of the larger day of which he was the flaming herald.	It would seem if there is one spot on the continent that should be hallowed ground to our Baptist people it is the one made sacred with his dust at the little rural church of Pine Pleasant in Saluda County, South Carolina.  The present simple marking is far too inadequate to be a worthy expression of the appreciation our people should feel and cherish for this pioneer and apostle of our modern Baptist world.  It seems fitting, therefore, that on this hundredth anniversary of his passing the Southern Baptist Convention should project some plan looking toward an enduring Memorial of his abundant life and labors.	RESOLVED, Therefore, (1) That the Convention looks with favor on the proposal to build some worthy and adequate memorial to mark the grave of the great leader;	(2)  That a committee of five be appointed to study the situation carefully, both as to the kind of memorial to be established, the necessary cost of the enterprise, and the ways and means of providing the same.  This committee shall be composed of Chas. A. Jones, South Carolina, Chairman; Rufus W. Weaver, District of Columbia; W. H. Williams, North Carolina; Ellis A. Fuller, Georgia, and W. L. Ball, South Carolina;	(3)  That this committee be requested to publish its findings and recommendations in the denominational press at least sixty days before the next Convention, and to submit the same to the next regular session.	(4)  That, since Luther Rice was an American Baptist in whom all of our people have a rich and royal inheritance, we do most heartily invite our fellow-Baptists of the Northern Convention to join us in this proposal to do honor to this hero of the faith; and that they be requested to appoint a similar committee to work with ours in maturing plans for the proposed memorial.	THE LUTHER RICE CENNTENNIAL COMMITTEE	The Luther Rice Centennial Committee has cooperated with like committees from the Baptist World Alliance, the Northern Baptist Convention, the Columbia Association of Baptist Churches and the First Baptist Church, Washington, D.C., in the organization of the Luther Rice Centennial Commission, a corporation chartered under the laws of the District of Columbia.	The representatives of the several participating Baptist bodies met in Washington, September 18, 1935, and organized with the following officers:  Dr. Geo. W. Truett, honorary president, Dr. J. H. Rushbrooke, honorary vice-president, Dr. J. H. Franklin, president, Dr. Charles E. Maddry, vice-president, Mr. W. W. Everett, treasurer, Mr. E. X. DeGrott, secretary, and Dr. Rufus W. Weaver, executive director.  The headquarters of the Commission are located at 715 8th St., N.W., Washington, D.C.	Since the organization of the Committee a sum of money has been raised to cover postage, stenographic work and other expenses incident to the preparation for the observance of the Centennial of the death of Luther Rice, September 25, 1936.	The executive director, Dr. Weaver, has traveled over eight thousand miles, made a score of addresses, written and secured the publication of many articles and all this at a total cost to the Commission of $13.50.  Those who are laboring to make this Centennial a success are giving both time and talent without any other remuneration than the joy of calling to the attention of the Baptists of America the man to whom they owe a greater debt of gratitude than to any other leader who has risen among us.	The chief interest centers upon the Luther Rice Centennial Day, September 25, 1936, when the Baptists, North and South, East and West, will gather at the Pine Pleasant Baptist Church, near Saluda, S.C., to pay honor to the memory of Luther Rice.  The Governor in South Carolina, honorable Olin D. Johnston, a leading Baptist layman, has given the Commission assurance that by proclamation he would set aside September 25, 1936, as the Luther Rice Memorial Day and that he will attend in person the celebration for the purpose of welcoming the Baptists of America to South Carolina.  The Baptist women of South Carolina will care for the entertainment of those that come.  A broadcast with a nation-wide hook-up is being planned.  Seminaries, colleges and State Conventions are being asked to put on suitable programs.  All the Baptist churches of America are being requested to observe the Centennial of the funeral of Luther Rice, Sunday, September 27, 1936, as the Luther Rice Memorial Day, when sermons will be preached upon the Apostolic labors of this devoted leader.	The success of the movement depends upon the voluntary cooperation of Baptist pastors and churches.  A brochure entitled ""The Place of Luther Rice in American Baptist Life,"" giving a brief account of his labors will be mailed to any one sending eight cents in stamps to the headquarters, 715 8th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.  The best available work, ""Luther Rice, Pioneer in Missions and Education,"" can be secured from the Baptist Sunday School Board or the American Baptist Publication Society for the small sum of $1.00.",1936

"211","WHEREAS, The Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention began its work in the Kingdom of Roumania in the year 1922, and now has in Roumania approximately 400 Baptist churches and 40,000 communicants; and	WHEREAS, In the Roumanian Constitution, adopted after the close of the World War, absolute religious liberty and freedom of worship were guaranteed to all religious groups alike, and the Baptists being now the largest non-Catholic group in Roumania; and	WHEREAS, The Roumanian Government has refused, and still does refuse to grant recognition to the Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention, a worthy, responsible and religious corporate body, and has repeatedly subjected our Foreign Mission Board, its missionaries and its educational institutions to many injustices, some of which we now set forth in concrete terms in order to show the wrongs so inflicted upon our Foreign Mission Board and our Baptist brethren of Roumania, namely:	1.  Refusal after repeated promises, to grant recognition to the Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention, as a responsible religious agency with the right to own and hold property for non-profit purposes in the Roumanian Kingdom.	2.  Excessive and unjust taxes levied against the land and buildings of our Baptist Theological Seminary and Woman's Religious Training School in the City of Bucharest, such taxes having become so excessive, as to be confiscatory.  Nevertheless, the laws of Roumania provide that all religious agencies and institutions of a non-profit nature shall be free from taxation.	3.  Repeated interference on the part of local police with the work and worship of Baptist churches throughout the kingdom.  The Roumanian Constitution grants religious freedom and liberty to all religious cults, and then the authorities repeatedly and continuously inflict upon Baptists, all kinds of insults indignities and persecutions, even to the extent of throwing Baptist preachers into prison.	4.  Within recent months Rev. Walter E. Craighead, of Chattanooga, Tennessee, the missionary of the Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention in the Province of Bessarabia, Roumania, on reaching a town where he was to preach was taken from the train by the police and cast into a vile dungeon.  He was kept in prison for forty-eight hours and was subjected to all sorts of insults and indignities, although he had a permit from the governmental authorities granting him the privilege of preaching anywhere in the kingdom.  He was denied the opportunity of communicating with his friends and when released was put on a train and banished from the city.	Now, Therefore, Be it RESOLVED, That the Southern Baptist Convention, in annual communication assembled, acting for and on behalf of its Foreign Mission Board, hereby earnestly entreats the Honorable Cordell Hull, Secretary of State of the United States of America, to protest to the Roumanian Government against the unjust and unrighteous treatment of the missionaries of the Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention and our native co-religionists in Roumania.  That the Southern Baptist Convention makes this request as the representative of 4,500,000 Southern Baptists living in eighteen Southern and Southwestern States of the United States of America.	ITALIAN RESOLUTION	WHEREAS, The Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention, as the representative of members of the Baptist denomination in eighteen of the Southern and Southwestern States of the United States of America, which began its mission work in Italy in the year 1870, and through the years since has commissioned between twelve and fifteen American missionaries for its religious work in Italy, and at this time has a worthy and substantial Baptist organization throughout Italy under the leadership of its American missionaries and a group of scholarly and devoted native Italian ministers, and until recently has enjoyed a measure of freedom and liberty in the propagation of the religious faith represented by the Southern Baptist Convention, but within recent months the missionaries and co-religionists who represent our Foreign Mission Board in Italy have been subjected to many petty persecutions, and have been hindered at every turn with hostile and unreasonable police regulations and restrictions; and	WHEREAS, Some of the wrongs suffered by the members of the Baptist churches in Italy in recent months are as follows:	1.  The expropriation of approximately fifteen acres of land situated on Monte Mario overlooking the City of Rome, for $82,000, being one-third of its appraised value, which land is owned by the Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, in the United States of America.	2.  The decision of the Italian Government to require our Foreign Mission Board to receive payment for said land in Italian bonds, which it is not willing to accept in settlement of a forced purchase price valued in dollars.	3.  The further decision of the Italian Government that our Foreign Mission Board will not be permitted to transfer the proceeds of this so-called sale of its property out of Italy, nor to reinvest in land in Italy without the approval of the Italian Government.	4.  The closing of several churches and out-stations organized and conducted through our Foreign Mission Board and the refusal of the Italian Government to allow pastors of these churches to preach or exercise the pastoral function; and	WHEREAS, In view of the unjust and arbitrary acts and decisions of the Italian Government hereinabove set forth, the Southern Baptists of America, acting through its Foreign Mission Board, are unable to cooperate in any worthy way with our Baptist co-religionists in Italy;	Now, Therefore, Be it RESOLVED, That the Southern Baptist Convention, in annual communication assembled, acting for and on behalf of its Foreign Mission Board, hereby earnestly entreats the Honorable Cordell Hull, Secretary of State of the United States Government, to request and direct Ambassador Long, the representative of the United States Government at Rome, Italy, to use every honorable means possible to induce the Italian Government to take prompt steps to rectify the unjust and grievous wrongs hereinabove mentioned and now being inflicted upon the Baptists of Italy.	We recommend further that a special commission be appointed to present this matter to the Baptist World Alliance and the Secretary of State, Honorable Cordell Hull.

That we reaffirm our belief that a political unit, of whatever size, should have the right to rid itself of the liquor evil by a majority vote.  This should not confer upon the smaller political unit the right to establish the liquor traffic against the will of the majority in the larger unit, as is now being urged by many liquor advocates.  We urge that, whenever any state legalizes the traffic, in whatever form, this policy be embodied in the legislation and used as rapidly and widely as possible for driving liquor out and increasing dry territory.	5.  That we urge the dry forces throughout the nation to secure as rapidly as possible legislation to accomplish the following:  (1)  The removal of the sale of liquor from all unpoliced areas.  (2)  The elimination of the sale of liquors from all gasoline filling stations and airports at which the sale of liquors is most anomalous and most destructive.  (3)  More adequate legislation to protect the public against the drinking driver who is increasing so frightfully the number of highway accidents and fatalities.  (4)  To secure a more accurate and adequate classification of accidents and crime and the relation of the consumption of liquor thereto, and the more uniform and adequate publication of such data.	6.  That we deplore the failure of the present National Administration to keep its solemn and repeated promises to enforce by appropriate legislation the second section of the 21st Amendment for the protection of dry states, and we call upon the President and the Congress to keep faith with the people and to redeem these promises.	7.  That we stand unalterably committed to the principle of prohibition and the belief that it is a crime for any government, national, state or local, to license or sponsor the traffic in alcoholic beverages.

"221","WHEREAS, It is evident that there is universal need of a spiritual awakening today; and	WHEREAS, All spiritual awakenings come as a result of earnest, fervent, believing prayer; and	WHEREAS, The Home Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention has revived the Department of Evangelism; now, therefore, be it	RESOLVED, That the Southern Baptist Convention in annual session convened, endorse a Convention-wide prayer-covenant, this covenant to become effective immediately upon the adoption of this resolution; the prayer to be for a deeper and stronger faith in each individual Christian life, resulting in a complete surrender of our lives to the Master's cause; that Christ's people shall be so filled with the Holy Spirit that a worldwide revival shall be the result; that God shall put within our hearts a burning passion for lost souls and that we shall heed the voice of the Holy Spirit and go forth under his leadership to win souls for Christ.	Furthermore, in order that all who enter into this covenant might be praying at the same time, let those who observe Eastern Standard Time, pray at 10:00 a.m., those in the Central Time zone, pray at 9:00 a.m., those in the Mountain Time zone at 8:00 a.m., and if there be any in the Pacific Time zone, at 7:00 a.m.	Furthermore, that our Fraternal Messenger to the Northern Baptist Convention advise that body of this action, and invite them to join with us in this covenant to pray.--Glen Eric Wiley, Florida",1937

International Relationships;	1.  We recognize that a warless world is the Christian ideal and that we Christians should throw all our weight and power into the balance for peace.	2.  That we petition the President of the United States to consider the advisability of calling a conference of world powers to consider the possibility of disarmament, believing that this would do much to relieve strained international relationships which are endangering world peace at the present time.	3.  That a formal letter of gratitude be sent to General and Madam Chiang Kai-Shek, expressing to them and the people of the Chinese Republic our deep appreciation for their recent gift to the flood sufferers of this country which we believe to have been a splendid expression of Christian fraternalism.

"225","	1.  We declare afresh our unalterable opposition to the whole liquor traffic, whisky, beer, and wine, and to the license system by which this most blighting and corrupting traffic fastened upon our body social and body politic.	2.  We stand unalterable for total abstinence on the part of the individual and for prohibition by the government, local, State, and National, and that we declare relentless war upon the liquor traffic, both legal and illegal, until it shall be banished.	3.  We cannot but express our hearty disapproval of the acts of the legislatures of North Carolina, Alabama, and Georgia, by which they flouted the will of the people of their respective states, as expressed at the ballot box, and usurped the rights of the people by fastening the liquor traffic upon their states at the will of wet counties, thus destroying the integrity and authority of the state as a unit to govern by the will of the majority of its citizens in every part of its territory.	4.  In keeping with a fundamental principle upheld by a long line of court decisions the majority of citizens in any political unit, however small, have the right to banish from their midst a recognized evil, even when such evil is licensed or tolerated by the larger political unit of which the smaller is a part.  But no political unit has a right to establish and maintain an evil against the will of the majority of the larger political unit.  This is the right of local option.  This principle was put in reverse and utterly violated by the legislatures of North Carolina, Alabama, and Georgia when they permitted wet counties to establish liquor stores.	5.  That we express our great pleasure in what appears to be the rising tide of prohibition sentiment, as indicated in the statewide dry victories in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee, the last by such an overwhelming majority, and in the great number of dry victories in local option elections in counties and smaller units in all the states where such elections have been called.  We hope and believe that an aroused public sentiment, outraged by the increasing crimes and highway fatalities brought by the liquor traffic, and the increasing disregard of law and decency by the traffic, shall soon again and permanently place upon the liquor traffic, shall soon again and permanently place upon the liquor traffic the brand of the outlaw, which it so richly deserves	6.  (a)  That this Convention earnestly recommends to our Baptist people, both pastors and churches, that the churches take a firm and consistent stand against all indulgence in the use of intoxicating liquors, including wine and beer, and against all participation in their sale by members of the churches, and that we seek as rapidly as possible to educate our people against the folly and sin of such use and sale, and that as rapidly as possible our churches shall be relieved of the open shame and burden of church members in any way connected with the unholy traffic; (b)  that our churches be urged to give their full moral support to the prohibition cause, and to give a more liberal financial support to dry organizations which stand for the united action of our people against the liquor traffic.",1938
"226","WHEREAS, For years it has been generally recognized that our peculiar and prized Baptist polity has under existing circumstances permitted so many of our Baptist people to be of personal loss to our local churches and denominational bodies through the practice of church membership in absentia, and	WHEREAS, A recent questionnaire sent out to 100 rural, town, and city pastors in every Southern Baptist Convention state shows that of a total membership of 56,453 in 41 of these particular churches, 28 percent of the recorded members are living too far from their churches to function as members while they do not join themselves to the Baptist Christians in the new communities, and	WHEREAS, With only one or two exceptions, every pastor who responded declared that the large percentage of absentee members constitutes a challenging church and denominational problem, which almost all of them state could be solved to some appreciable degree even by Baptists, and that southern Baptists should take steps to attain such ends, therefore,	BE IT RESOLVED, That the Southern Baptist Convention here and now select by due processes a committee or commission, representative of every state in the Convention, whose purpose it will be to give more extensive study to this matter and make a comprehensive report with recommendations at the 1939 session of the Convention . . . provided the committee's activities in this matter shall be of no expense to the Convention.",1938

Third--And that we invite the cooperation of all our colored, Mexican, and other nationalities to join with us in the movement.

That it is the duty and obligation of the citizen to give patriotic support to the government in all worthy enterprises so long as the government recognizes these principles and that conservely it is the duty and obligation of the citizen to do all in his power to keep the government true to these principles and to resist in every way possible under the Constitution all governmental policies that would infringe upon these fundamental rights.

That we rejoice that under our American system of freedom, in which individual initiative and prowess have free play, we have been able to build a great civilization with large aggregations of wealth, both individual and corporate, which make possible our great industries and give labor its largest and best opportunities for remunerative employment; and that our per capita wealth is more widely distributed among the citizens than in any other nation, and that living conditions with the laboring masses, while not perfect or always satisfactory, are better than in any other nation in the world.	3.  That we recognize the right of ownership and the right of capital to investment and to a reasonable return upon investment; that all men should recognize that ownership is trusteeship and that all property, whether large or small, should be administered unselfishly and for the good of humanity.	4.  That we recognize the right of labor to organize and to engage in collective bargaining to the end that labor may have a fair and living wage, such as will provide not only for the necessities of life but for recreation, pleasure and culture.	5.  That there is no necessary clash or conflict between capital and labor and that they should work harmoniously with each other for the good of each and for the good of the general public.	6.  That we condemn all violence on the part of labor or capital and all arbitrary and illegal acts that violate fundamental principles and personal or property rights; all questions and contentions between labor and capital ought to be settled in the American way by conference and arbitration.	Child Labor	1.  That we approve and applaud the action of the legislatures of the several states of the Union in enacting laws regulating and limiting the employment of minors in gainful industrial pursuits and making school attendance compulsory, but recognizing the right of minors to engage in domestic and farm work under the direction of parents and guardians.	2.  That we urge our Baptist people as citizens to be diligent in demanding the proper enforcement of existing child labor laws, and demanding the enactment by the several states of whatever additional legislation may be necessary to prevent the exploitation of child labor and to promote the best possible development and education of the youth of our land.	3.  We likewise commend and applaud the repeated refusal of the legislatures of those states which have refused to ratify the so-called Child Labor Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, under which, if ratified by the necessary three-fourths of the states, the government would ""have the power to limit, regulate and prohibit the labor of persons under eighteen years of age.""  While exploited as intended to protect children this amendment would really place in the hands of the Federal Government the complete control of all young people up to eighteen years of age, destroying in principle, and we fear ultimately in practice, all parental authority and making children wards of the government.  Nothing could be more un-American or destructive of the home life of our people or could militate in a more definite and radical way against the well-being of the children and youth of our nation.

We understand and sympathize with the normal needs of Japan, but these cannot justify the imperialism of the militaristic regime by which the human rights of another people are ruthlessly disregarded.  We are especially concerned over the fact that Americans are sharing so largely in this unholy work and without interference by the American Government.  We most earnestly plead with our National Administration and our Congress most speedily to take every possible measure to stop the supply of the instruments and materials of destruction from flowing from our country into Japan.  And we instruct our Secretaries to transmit this action to the President of the United States, the State Department and the Chairmen of the Committees on Foreign Affairs of both the Senate and the House of Representatives.	We further suggest the imminent desirability that our people throughout the territory of our Convention shall write to their representatives in both Houses of Congress, earnestly urging action to stop American participation in this war of conquest.

That we suggest to the pastors and churches the advisability of setting up and maintaining a peace committee in every church for the dissemination of information and the cultivation of the spirit of peace.	3.  That if and when such committees shall be appointed it will be well for them not to enter into any organic contacts or relations with any general bodies without the full understanding and authority of their respective churches.  This rule must apply to all committees and auxiliary organizations in our Baptist Churches if we are to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the churches as New Testament democracies, free to cooperate through their own denominational agencies and at the same time free from entanling alliances with interdenominational and unionizing organizations and movements.",1939

That while lynching is not due wholly to racial antipathies nor the victims of lynching limited to any one race, it is beyond doubt or question that racial antipathies are often one of the chief contributing causes; That we are glad to believe and have many good reasons to believe that as between the white and colored races within the bounds of this Convention racial animosities are growing less and racial understanding and cooperation are increasing, as indicated by the fact that the white people of the South, especially our Baptist pastors and churches, are establishing and maintaining frequent contacts of a friendly and helpful nature with the Negro race; That we urge our Baptist people everywhere to maintain and extend these friendly and helpful contacts and relations, remembering always the law of Christian obligation that the strong should bear the burdens of the weak, and yet doing this without any spirit of patronizing or air of condescending.	3.  That we recognize the many inequalities and injustices which still exist in the dealings of organized society and of individuals with the Negro race and in the provision made for the advancement of the Negro race, such as the disproportionate distribution of public school funds, the lack of equal and impartial administration of justice in the courts, inadequate wages paid for Negro labor and the lack of adequate industrial and commercial opportunity for the Negro race as a whole; That we pledge ourselves as Christians and citizens to use our influence and give our efforts for the correction of these inequalities and for securing for the Negro opportunities for his full development in his education, industrial and religious life.",1939

That we recognize in the decease of the late Pope the passing of a distinguished world citizen which brought keen sorrow to all peoples of his faith with whom we sympathize in the loss of their leader.	2.  That we, the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention in session at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, May 20, 1939, composed of messengers from a total church membership of more than four million Southern Baptists, do cheerfully recognize and champion every person's right and liberty to make his own choice in matters of religion.	3.  That the right and freedom of religious opinion does not justify the union or mingling of state and church, but rather requires and demands that the two be kept separate and inviolate the one from the other.	4.  That we deplore and protest such actions by Congress and the President of the United States as unwise and unwarranted, and as indicating a dangerous tendency toward the union of church and state, which is a chief cause of the troubles of the old world.	5.  If the sending of the Ambassador of the United States was to honor the crowning of an ecclesiastical head we believe it was an obvious violation of the traditions of this Republic and of the spirit of the First Amendment of our Constitution even if, perhaps, not of its letter.  If this course was in honor of the crowning of the civil ruler of a state with which we are not in diplomatic relations it was as obviously an impropriety.	6.  That we request Congress and the President to adhere strictly to the principles on which our government was founded and the basal principle of separation of church and state so plainly taught in the first section of the bill of rights in our constitution.	7.  That copies of these resolutions be delivered by the Public Relations Committee to the President, to the Secretary of State, and to members of the House and Senate of the United States Congress.RESOLUTION CONCERNING FREEDOM OF RELIGION	1.  That we record our satisfaction that the new threat to the freedom of religion, the O'Day Bill, which would have brought our churches and all benevolent institutions under the taxing power of the government, was unanimously defeated in the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives.	2.  That while we rejoice in our freedom we must not use our freedom as an occasion of the flesh and that our denomination should make worthy and adequate provision for its aged and disabled ministers and religious workers of all classes.  The Minister's Retirement Plan, now being promoted by the Relief and Annuity Board, and already adopted by many of our Baptist institutions and by many of the States within the bounds of the Southern Baptist Convention, should be adopted by all and vigorously promoted until adequate provision shall be made for the physical comfort and well being of all aged and disabled ministers and all other workers who give their entire time, effort and strength to the promotion of our Baptist interests.	RESOLUTION CONCERNING A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT	1.  That we look with grave concern upon the act of the President of the United States in sending Ambassador Jos. P. Kennedy to the ""coronation"" of Pope Pius XII, as the President's representative;	2.  That in this act, in our opinion, the President made a grave departure from the spirit of the constitution and brought pain to the great majority of the American people.	3.  That we are especially concerned lest this act foreshadow some purpose on the part of the administration to enter into diplomatic relations with the Vatican, against which we would deeply and earnestly protest.",1939

"249","	Be it resolved by the Southern Baptist Convention in annual session assembled in the city of Baltimore, Maryland, June 12-16, 1940:	1.  We cannot without deep concern look upon the vast number of human lives sacrificed and the still larger number maimed by accident in our country.  It seems as incredible as it is shocking that a great people in the ordinary pursuits of peace should sacrifice nearly 100,000 lives each year by accidental death, and at the same time bring non-fatal injuries to nearly nine million.	2.  All available facts indicate that a large percentage both of the fatal and non-fatal accidents come as the result of the use of alcoholic beverages, both on the part of the automobile drivers and on the part of the pedestrians.  We cannot too severely condemn a situation that makes it possible for men to operate motor cars or to walk the streets and highways when under the influence of intoxicating beverages in however slight degree.	3.  We the members of the Convention pledge ourselves to care and discretion in the operation of motor vehicles and in all other matters to the end that we may assist in reducing the enormous toll of human life taken by accident.	RESOLUTION CONCERNING THE LIQUOR TRAFFIC	Be it resolved by the Southern Baptist Convention in annual session assembled in the city of Baltimore, Maryland, June 12-16, 1940:	1.  We look with grave concern upon the widespread use of alcoholic drinks among the masses of our people, especially the young people and the girls and women.  No nation can rise above its motherhood.  If we raise a generation of drinking and drunken mothers we may expect a sodden civilization.	2.  We urge upon all Pastors, Editors, College Presidents and Teachers, upon the officers and teachers of our churches and upon the churches themselves, their solemn obligation for taking and maintaining a consistent stand against the use of intoxicating beverages by the individual and against the policy of legalization by the State.	3.  We affirm our unchanged and unchangeable opposition to the beverage use of alcoholic drinks in all forms and to the policy of government which legalizes and thus promotes the manufacture, distribution, sale and consumption of such beverages.  Total abstinence by the individual and legal suppression by the government are the only safe, sane and justifiable courses to be pursued in regard to a habit-forming and destructive poison.	4.  That while we do not recede in the least degree from our belief in legal suppression by the government, we pledge special emphasis upon the scientific and educational approach to the solution of the liquor problem.  If our young people and all others can be taught and can become deeply convinced of the destructive nature of alcohol and can be brought to total abstinence, the liquor problem will be solved.",1940
"250","	WHEREAS, The present condition of the world creates a greater need for the Bible than ever in history, and	WHEREAS, Most of the world must depend upon the great Bible Societies for its supply of Scriptures, and	WHEREAS, The British and Foreign Bible Society, which shares with the American Bible Society the responsibility for supplying our missionaries in foreign lands with Scriptures in many languages, is seriously handicapped because of the war, and the American Bible Society is undertaking to expand its service to meet the emergency, therefore be it	RESOLVED, That we urge our churches either on Universal Bible Sunday, December 8, or on some other convenient date, to make a special offering of not less than five dollars ($5.00) toward the Emergency Fund of the American Bible Society.",1940

RESOLUTION OF APPRECIATION	WHEREAS, The messengers to this Convention have been greatly helped by the daily distribution of the Convention Bulletin, and	WHEREAS, Brother Walter M. Gilmore has directed this phase of our Convention program with such efficiency in order to give an accurate summary of the daily proceedings, giving much time day and night to the preparation of this Bulletin, and	WHEREAS, As Publicity Director of the Executive Committee of the Southern Baptist Convention he has rendered such vital service to the Editors of the denominational papers by furnishing to them copies of the digests of reports and addresses delivered before this Convention, and other valuable material, making it possible for them to pass on to their readers better accounts and more accurate information concerning the proceedings of the Convention.	BE IT RESOLVED, That the messengers do hereby express to Brother Gilmore, and his efficient helpers, our deep and abiding gratitude.",1940
"253","1.  That we hereby reaffirm our unfaltering belief in and our deep devotion to the principle of the absolute freedom of the individual in all the concerns of religion and in all acts of worship, both private and public, and in its corrollary the complete separation of church and state, or of organized religion and of organized government, in so far as directing authority and right of control are concerned.  Each and every individual is endowed by the Creator with the unalienable right to worship as his own conscience may direct, or even not to worship at all if he is so inclined.  Over religious beliefs and religious acts neither the state nor the head of the state may properly assume to exercise any authority or control.  Nor can organized religion assume any authority or control over the affairs of the state.	2.  That this principle of the freedom of religion and of the separation of church and state excludes all financial grants and subsidies from governmental funds derived from taxes levied upon citizens to the promotion of religion as such or to the maintenance of teachers of religion or to the maintenance and promotion of churches and other religious institutions whether missionary, educational or benevolent, which are built and fostered by religious denominations, or under distinctly religious auspices.	3.  That this principle, with all of its implications, is expressed in the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States, commonly known as the Bill of Rights; that this is the most distinct and distinctive principle of the government of the United States, and is the largest contribution made by the United States of America to the political thought of the world.  Just as this principle is the most vital and distinctive principle of American life, its preservation and inviolability are, and of a right should be, a matter of deepest concern to every citizen of this government.	4.  That we deeply deplore the fact that in recent years both the Federal Government and many of the State Governments, have shown a careless disregard for this principle and have resorted to many and varied schemes for offering financial subsidies to religion and religious institutions.  All of these schemes, whether they offer money directly or indirectly to denominational colleges and Roman Catholic parochial schools, are simply the nose of the camel finding its way into the tent.  If these things are not checked and if religious institutions, especially Baptist Colleges and Colleges of other evangelical denominations, do not spurn all offers of governmental subsidies the time is not far distant when freedom of religion and the separation of church and state will be things of the past.	5.  That we express our earnest disapproval of Senate Bill 3579, introduced by Senator Walsh of Massachusetts, which proposes so to amend the Social Security Act as it bring churches under its operation; that we suggest to our Baptist people that they use their influence with their Senators and Representatives to prevent the passage of this Bill; and that the Social Service Commission be authorized officially to indicate to members of Congress the mind of this Convention touching this matter.  The Bill is objectionable both because it would impose a tax on churches and also and particularly because it would be class legislation, exempting from its operation churches or denominations having religious orders.	Southern Baptists heretofore have held and do now hold fast the American principle of the Separation of Church and State.	They believe that the power to tax is also the power to reform, to change, to destroy even; Therefore,	Be it resolved, That we now register our opposition to the amendments to the Social Security Act which are now pending in Congress, which amendments would if enacted by Congress place a tax upon all of our churches, our schools, our orphanages, our missionary and benevolent boards, and all other agencies of the denomination.	Be it resolved further, That Southern Baptists do not favor amending the Social Security Act at all; however, if in the judgment of Congress the Social Security Act should be amended in order to include in its provisions employees of secular non-profit organizations then this Convention insists that such amendment shall definitely exempt all employees of religious denominations, churches, boards, institutions educational and benevolent and all other non-profit agencies of the religious bodies of the United States.	Resolved further, That the Southern Baptist Convention whose constituency numbers some five million members with a family attachment of some fifteen million persons does not agree to the proposed Walsh Amendment as contained in Senate Bill No. 3579 which would be able to transmute a general tax into a ""true contribution"" by the process of placing money thus raised into a Social Security Trust Fund of the Federal Government.  On the contrary, this bill would merely convert a general tax into a tax for a special purpose.	The tax proposed by Senate Bill No. 3579 would in our sober judgment be violative of the American principle of the Separation of Church and State and would amount to usurpation of the powers of the Federal Government with reference to religious bodies of every faith--Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, and all others.",1940
"254","Be it resolved by the Southern Baptist Convention in annual session assembled in the city of Baltimore, June 12-16, 1940:	1.  That we hereby express our utter abhorrence of war as an instrument of International policy and our profound conviction and belief that all International differences could and of a right ought to be composed by peaceful diplomatic exchanges, and, when these fail, by arbitration.	2.  That the continued sacrifice of human treasure and human blood in International war is a wanton and wicked waste for which nations, and particularly their rulers who declare and prosecute war, must give an account to the All Wise and All Just Judge of all the earth.	3.  That the extremes of human slaughter to which the present mechanized war has gone staggers human belief and is a sad illustration of how all scientific knowledge and development, which should contribute only to human welfare, can be debased and devoted to human destruction.	4.  That while there may be many contributing causes for war, we believe that the deepest and most basic cause for war is a materialistic education and a materialistic philosophy of life, which exalts man and debases and depersonalizes God as the creator and the preserver of all life and as the Saviour of man.  We believe, therefore, it is of the utmost importance that our system of education, both private and public, shall be jealously guarded and kept true to the fundamental conceptions of the personality of God and of the authority of His revealed will, both in His word and in the person of His Son.	5.  That in the present frightful conditions prevailing throughout the world we urge upon the President of the United States and upon the Secretary of State, and all others in authoritative position, to use all possible wisdom and every possible precaution to prevent our nation from becoming involved in the present world conflict, and to maintain consistently the position of the United States as the largest and most influential neutral nation so that when the time arrives our nation may make the largest possible contribution to a well considered and a just and lasting peace.	6.  That while we acknowledge the right of national self-defense, our utter abhorrence of war and its attendant evils compels us to voice the conviction that even a defensive war should be waged only as a last resort after every effort has been made to reach a settlement of international problems in fairness to all the nations involved.	7.  That we protest the continued shipment of scrap iron and other war materials from America to Japan to be used by Japan in her ruthless war of invasion and conquest against China; that this shipment seems all the more unjust and inexcusable since the termination of the international trade treaty which leaves our government free to act in this matter; that our government be and it is hereby respectfully and earnestly petitioned to use all its powers and prerogatives to prevent the continuation of this aid to an imperialistic power, making war upon a peaceful and friendly nation.	8.  Baptists have always believed in liberty of conscience and have honored men who were willing to brave adverse public opinion for the sake of conscientious scruples.  A considerable number of members of churches of our Convention, through their interpretation of the moral teachings of Christ, have reached the position of a conscientious objection to war that prohibits them from bearing arms.	The Convention ought to accord to them the right of their convictions as it accords to others the right to differ from them, and ought to protect them in that right to the extend of its ability.  Therefore,	Be it RESOLVED, That the Convention go on record as recognizing such right of a conscientious objection, and that the Convention instruct the Executive Committee to provide facilities for their registration with the denomination, in order that the Executive Committee may be able to make accurate certification to the government concerning them at any time it should be called for.	9.  Because war is contrary to the mind and spirit of Christ, we believe that no war should be identified with the will of Christ.  Our churches should not be made agents of war propaganda or recruiting stations.  War thrives on and is perpetuated by hysteria, falsehood, and hate and the church has a solemn responsibility to make sure there is no black out of love in time of war.  When men and nations are going mad with hate it is the duty of Christ's ministers and His churches to declare by spirit, word, and conduct the love of God in all men.  In time of war it is our Christian responsibility to prepare for peace.  We would, therefore, urge our churches to think and work toward a Christian social order in which a just and lasting peace can be realized.",1940
"255","Be it resolved by the Southern Baptist Convention in annual session assembled in the city of Baltimore, Maryland, June 12-16, 1940:	1.  That we rejoice in the freedom of the press as guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, and look upon it as one of the bulwarks of our liberties.  Under no condition would we consent to an impairment of this freedom.	2.  But the freedom of the press, like all other forms of freedom, is subject to misuse and abuse.  Surely the press should regard itself as one of the custodians of cultural ideals and of public morals.	3.  We regard the constant outflow from the presses of the nation of salacious and smutty books and periodicals as a serious menace to the ideals and morals of our people, especially of the youth of the land.  We believe that all proper authority should be exercised to limit and to prevent this corrupt stream, which undoubtedly is working the downfall of many eager, growing and promising young people.	4.  We pledge ourselves to aid in every way possible in a general cleanup of the newsstands, and we would particularly recognize the fact that here as elsewhere the most effective way to destroy evil is to overcome evil with good, which we must do by placing good wholesome literature and books into the hands of the masses of our people.",1940

That we will continue to exercise all diligence and to urge upon our entire Baptist constituency and upon the citizenry at large the continued exercise of all diligence that this form of barbarism may be entirely banished and may have no recrudescence.	3.  That we rejoice in the continued lessening of interracial antipathies and friction and in the increasing betterment of interracial understanding, good will and cooperation.	4.  That we shall strive to cultivate and perpetuate this growing inter-racial good will and shall strive to the end that our friends and neighbors of the Negro race shall have, in all instances, equal and impartial justice before the courts; better and more equitable opportunities in industrial, business, and professional engagements; and a more equitable share in public funds and more adequate opportunities in the field of education",1940
"257","In this tragic hour of struggle between the totalitarian concept of force and the democratic concept of liberty, when the call has gone out for continuing effort to make democracy work within our own borders, when the love of freedom, we are happy to believe, is aflame in the hearts of our people, we feel impelled from deep conviction and from the verdict of history to register our considered judgment touching a matter of vital concern not only to our Southern Baptist people from Maryland to Texas and from Illinois to Florida, but as well to all men alike everywhere, both for the present and the unfolding future.	Believing that a priceless and cherished principle is involved--a principle which must be kept inviolate at all times and supremely so in these testing days, we, the messengers from the 25,018 churches composing the Southern Baptist Convention, with a membership of 4,949,174 persons, in this the 85th annual session, this June 12, 1940, in Baltimore, Maryland, make this statement:	1.  That the President of the United States did, on December 24, 1939, announce the appointment of the Honorable Myron Taylor as the representative of this government to the Vatican with the rank of ambassador.	2.  That subsequent developments have established the fact that the appointment was made without the consent or advice of the Senate; that he is to report from time to time to this government; that his term of appointment is unlimited; that the Vatican has officially received him as an ambassador from this government.	3.  That this action on the part of the President of the United States appears clearly to be in direct violation of the Constitution of the United States, section two, paragraph two, which reads:  ""The President shall have power, by and with the consent and advice of the Senate, to appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls. . . .""; and, article one of the amendments to the Constitution, which reads:  ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise therefore . . .""	4.  That we profoundly believe that this action on the part of the President of the United States does definitely jeopardize the cherished principle of complete separation of church and state, for which principle our fathers suffered that the citizens of this nation, irrespective of creed or class, might alike enjoy religious liberty.	5.  That we do most heartily commend the efforts of the President and all fellow Americans in seeking by every rightful and lawful method and measure to promote the peace of the world and to alleviate human suffering.	6.  That we are compelled in conscience most earnestly to protest the action of the President of the United States in his appointment of a representative from this government to the Vatican with the rank of ambassador, whether as a temporary expedient or as a step towards permanent diplomatic relations, even as we would protest such an appointment to any other religious body in the world.	7.  That we are compelled to register this protest in the firm conviction that if the President's action in appointing an ambassador to the Vatican is not terminated, it will bring further and constantly increasing confusion within our own nation and definitely embarrass our international relationships in an hour when our nation should be united in meeting the sinister challenge of totalitarianism to democracy.	8.  That we respectfully voice the very earnest hope that the President will terminate this appointment, and we pledge him anew our uncompromising desire and purpose to preserve here in our nation a free church in a free state as one of the cardinal principles of democracy, which, we pray God, shall not perish from the earth.	9.  That a copy of this statement be sent to the President of the United States.	RESOLUTION CONCERNING FREEDOM OF RELIGION	1.  That we hereby reaffirm our unfaltering belief in and our deep devotion to the principle of the absolute freedom of the individual in all the concerns of religion and in all acts of worship, both private and public, and in its corollary the complete separation of church and state, or of organized religion and of organized government, in so far as directing authority and right of control are concerned.

RESOLUTION CONCERNING THE PRESIDENT AND THE VATICAN	Be it resolved by the Southern Baptist Convention in annual session assembled in the city of Baltimore, Maryland, June 12-16, 1940:1.	That, while we accord to the President of the United States all credit for worthy motives in all of his efforts to secure International Peace, we cannot but express deep disappointment and regret at the method he adopted in linking his efforts with the Vatican.  We cannot but believe that the President did the cause of peace and the government of the United States a great disservice when he brought the influence of the United States, the greatest neutral power, into alliance and in essence made it subject and subservient to the Vatican.2.	That we cannot but express our disapproval of the Presidents action in sending Mr. Myron C. Taylor as his special, or personal representative to the Vatican, and assigning him the rank of ambassador, without consulting the Senate, and in violation and circumvention of the plain meeting of the Constitution.3.	That we solemnly and earnestly enter our protest against the action taken by the President in this matter and solemnly and earnestly request that he take steps immediately to recall Mr. Taylor as his representative to the Vatican, thereby reassuring the people of the United States that he does not propose to continue a violation of a fundamental principle of our American Government, and of the rights and prerogatives of the Presidential office.

Be it RESOLVED FURTHER, That Southern Baptists do not favor amending the Social Security Act at all; however, if in the judgment of Congress the Social Security Act should be amended in order to include in its provisions employees of secular non-profit organizations then this Convention insists that such amendment shall definitely exempt all employees of religious denominations, churches, boards, institutions educational and benevolent and all other non-profit agencies of the religious bodies of the United States.	RESOLVED FURTHER, That the Southern Baptist Convention whose constituency numbers some five million members with a family attachment of some fifteen million persons does not agree to the proposed Walsh Amendment as contained in Senate Bill No. 3579 which would be able to transmute a general tax into a ""true contribution"" by the process of placing money thus raised into a Social Security Trust Fund of the Federal Government.  On the contrary, this bill would merely convert a general tax into a tax for a special purpose.	The tax proposed by Senate Bill No. 3579 would in our sober judgment be violative of the American principle of the Separation of Church and State and would amount to usurpation of the powers of the Federal Government with reference to religious bodies of every faith--Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, and all others.",1940
"261","	Be it resolved by the Southern Baptist Convention in annual session assembled:	1.  That we hereby give renewed expression to our intense hatred of alcoholic drinks in all forms at all times and in all places, and that we urge upon our people the duty and obligation of total abstinence on their part and the support of every public measure which has for its purpose the reduction and the abolition of the legalized traffic in alcoholic beverages, whatever their form and whatever their alcoholic content.	2.  That at the present time of national and world crisis we regard the relation of the drink evil to the matter of national defense as the most acute and urgent phase of this evil.	3.  That we deprecate the conditions developing around the military camps with respect to vice and alcoholic beverages, and pledge our cooperation to aid in the creation of a better environment and the establishment of more adequate recreational facilities in the vicinity of military and naval posts.	4.  That we urge the President of the United States as Commander in Chief of the Army and the Navy to use the great influence and powers of his office to enlist the cooperation of state and local officials to take such action as will protect our military and naval trainees from exploitation in the vicinity of army and naval establishments, and pledge our co-operation in such efforts.	5.  That we believe it to be the duty of the loyal citizens in such a time of national crisis to bring to the attention of the President of the United States, to the Governors of the several states, and to the law enforcement agencies the activities of those who would exploit the defenders of our country for profit.	6.  That we urge the Congress to enact such legislation as may be appropriate under our present peace-time status for the protection of our military and naval services from the effects of vice and liquor.	7.  That we heartily approve of the Sheppard Bill, known as S. 860, and urge upon Congress the importance of its prompt enactment; that our pastors and people be urged to appeal to their Senators and Representatives in behalf of the enactment of this bill.	8.  That we express our belief and conviction that all liquor advertisements should be suppressed by appropriate legislation, both by the Federal Congress, and the State Legislatures.  That in particular we approve the Johnson Bill, known as S. 517, and the Capper Bill, known as S. 575, and urge upon Congress the importance of their enactment.  We would also recommend to our Baptist people that they appeal to their Senators and Representatives in behalf of the enactment of these two bills.",1941
"262","	Be it resolved by the Southern Baptist Convention in annual session assembled:	1.  That we deplore the fact that during 1940, 96,500 lives were sacrificed in accidental deaths and that 9,100,000 people were seriously injured by accident.  A large percentage of these deaths and injuries by accident were easily preventable if our people of all classes and of all conditions would be exercised by a spirit of caution and discretion.	2.  That we are especially concerned and grieved that a large percentage of the accidental deaths and accidental injuries should have been caused by the legalized liquor traffic, for which there is no possible excuse, and in which the government is bartering the lives of the people for a miserable pittance in revenue, every dollar of which is offset one hundred fold in the impairment of the health and happiness and prosperity of our people and in the almost numberless lives which this traffic annually snuffs out.	3.  That we pledge ourselves to the spirit of care and caution in the pursuit of our industries and particularly in the operation of motor vehicles on the highways and in all things else which will tend to conserve life and to reduce this heavy accidental toll.",1941
"263","	WHEREAS, our churches and missionaries both in the home and foreign fields have availed themselves of the services of the American Bible Society for many years, and	WHEREAS, If the American Bible Society were unable to serve our workers in supplying Scriptures at any price and in any language required, we should be forced to establish a Bible Society of our own at excessive cost to our churches, and	WHEREAS, The churches of the Southern Baptist Convention in 1940 contributed to the work of the American Bible Society only $938 which represents for 20 cents per 1,000 members or 4 cents per church.	THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That we suggest to the Secretaries of our State Conventions that they call the attention of the churches in their areas to these facts with a view to the church's making a contribution to the work of the American Bible Society during the calendar year 1941.",1941
"264","	In Birmingham we have seen on every hand evidences of thoughtful and careful preparation for the entertainment of Southern Baptists and the efficiency of this Convention.

"265","Be it resolved by the Southern Baptist Convention in annual session assembled:	1.  That we deplore the prevalence of crime in our nation as indicated by reliable figures.  It is nothing short of a national disgrace and surely ought to be an occasion for national concern that during the year 1940, 1,517,026 crimes of serious nature should have been committed.	2.  That we pledge ourselves to the cultivation of the spirit of law observance in all matters and to the promotion of such teaching in our schools and such discipline in our homes as will rapidly reduce these appalling figures and will establish the principles of sobriety, self-control, justice and mercy in the hearts and lives of the growing generation.	RESOLUTION CONCERNING EMBEZZLEMENT OF POWER	Be it resolved by the Southern Baptist Convention in annual session assembled:	1.  That we deprecate what seems to be a clear and unmistakable tendency on the part of some of our legislative bodies, including the Congress of the United States and some of the State Legislatures, to ignore and scout the rights of the people to determine their institutions at the ballot box.	2.  That it is our deep and abiding conviction that this is a rank and inexcusable denial and betrayal of the principles of our free institutions and democratic government for the defense of which we are spending billions upon billions of dollars.  What value will be the name of democracy if legislative bodies, whether national or state, force their will upon the people and refuse to allow the people to express themselves, or scout the will of the people as expressed at the ballot box?	3.  We pledge ourselves without the slightest hesitation or reservation to the principles of democracy and to the right of the people to determine by majority vote what shall be their institutions and whether or not such a curse as the liquor traffic shall be fastened upon the body politic.	Unanimously approved and recommended for adoption by the Commission.							Arthur J. Barton, Chairman	Amendment offered by L. E.

"266","WHEREAS, Southern Baptists constitute one of the largest democratic and evangelical bodies of Christians in the United States; and whereas they have over 25,000 churches with more than 5,000,000 bona fide members; and whereas some 10,000 members and ""messengers"" (or delegates) from these churches are meeting in Annual Convention in Birmingham, Ala., May 14-18, 1941, they feel it incumbent upon them and altogether appropriate for them to declare publicly certain of their clear convictions at this time of world crisis, in order that our burdened President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and our National Government may be appraised of the sentiments and convictions of the great majority of this body of patriotic and liberty-loving citizens.  While they thus record and publish their sentiments and convictions by majority vote in Convention assembled, they fully recognize and respect the inalienable right of conscientious objectors to hold and to voice contrary sentiments and conviction if they deem it wise to do so.	Therefore, Be It Resolved, by the Convention:	1.  That we declare our abhorrence of war and all its insanity and brutality.  We are a peace-loving people and we know of no issues, national or international, which could not be settled in fairness and equity by the orderly processes of civilized society if only the leaders of the nations were willing to practice the principles of justice, truth, and righteousness.  We sincerely believe that the rank and file of our denomination, even as the rank and file of our nation and the other nations as well, much prefer that all international disputes and conflicting interests be composed by the processes of peace rather than by the arbitrament of war.  But unfortunately men of evil mind and ungodly heart sometimes gain control within a nation, or nations, and with cruel and deadly intent thrust war upon the world in order to gratify their lust for glory and power and fancied gains for themselves and their associates.  Such men at the present time have criminally conspired to impose their anti-social, anti-Christian, and anti-human wills upon much of the world.  With fiendish force and diabolical scheming they have overrun Europe and threaten to gain the mastery over Asia and Africa.  Human rights, freedoms, and liberties have promptly gone into eclipse wherever the power of these ruthless men have been established.  They hold nothing as sacred, and they regard with scorn many of the treasured achievements of mankind.  They deny the physical, intellectual, moral, social, economic, and spiritual rights and liberties of all who in any way oppose them.  In other words, their principles and their practices are the absolute antithesis of everything we have been taught to believe is in line with the will of God, the mind of Christ and the kingdom of God on earth.  If these men are allowed to attain their announced worldwide aims and goals, then many of the values which we esteem as more precious than life itself will be lost, and the world will be immeasurably impoverished socially, politically, culturally, and spiritually.  We know not what course others may pursue but as for us we hold it were better to be dead than to live in a world dominated by the ideals of these modern dictators.	2.  We declare our belief that some things are worth dying for; and if they are worth dying for they are worth living for; and if they are worth living for they are worth defending even unto the death.  Among these are liberty under law, that sacred shrine called home, wives and children, the honor of one's country, and last but not least freedom of worship.  ""Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery"" forged by some cruel and godless tyrant?  ""Forbid it Almighty God!""  Thus was it prayed in other days when a tyrant sought to enslave our colonial Fathers.  We believe that Almighty God made answer to that prayer through the deeds of those fathers from Lexington to Yorktown.  Our Baptist Fathers opposed that tyrant and we, their spiritual descendants, are ready to oppose any other tyrant who impiously aspires to deprive us of any of our God-given and inalienable rights.  Shall we have a vision of eternal values less clear than had those early American Fathers?  Shall we in our strength forfeit those priceless values which they purchased with their blood and in their weakness?  May Almighty God forbid that also!	3.  Baptists are a democratic people--none more so.  Therefore, it is nothing but natural that our deepest sympathies should go out to those democracies of the world which have been crushed for the time being or now are sorely beset by ruthless powers which are committed to the overthrow of all democracies.  We are convinced that England's heroic resistance to the Axis powers is one of the great sagas of the human Spirit.  We, like the great majority of people in the United States, are in thorough sympathy with the efforts being made by our nation to reinforce England in many ways as she fights not only for her own life, but also, and incidentally, fights a terrible battle for the other democratic nations of the world.  It will be most gratifying to us if these efforts of the United States to reinforce England can be multiplied and be made increasingly effective.  We trust our Government to work out the wisest and most effective means to aid England, our national ally, in this titanic struggle.	We desire to register with our Government our clear conviction that the United States and her citizens should promptly cease supplying Japan with materials which enable her to continue her war of conquest against China.	We also urge our Government to quicken rather than slacken all measures needed to strengthen the defenses of the Western Hemisphere against all kinds of aggression from any and all powers which seek to undermine and to overthrow our peaceful and democratic ways of life.	4.  We pledge ourselves as Christian patriots to pray earnestly unto our God and Saviour that a righteous peace may soon be granted unto all the war-ring nations: that our own nation may be spared the horrors of war, if that be the divine will, and that our nation may be used as a mighty instrument of peace and truth and righteousness and brotherhood; that Almighty God will, in the power of his might, take charge of the nations and overrule their folly and sin to the praise of his great and holy name.	RESOLUTION III	WHEREAS, The nations of the world are at this moment engaged in one of the most tragic wars of human history, a war that is ruthless in its attack upon human life and upon all human values, both material and spiritual, and	WHEREAS, The role of our own nation in this international conflict becomes daily of increasing significance to all, and	WHEREAS, Not in all history has there been a greater need for divine vision and guidance on the part of these nations as each in his own way looks forward to the day when this war shall cease.	WHEREAS, The Word of God and the testimony of believers to the Living Christ point the way to divine wisdom and guidance, adequate to the needs of this grave hour, therefore,	Be it RESOLVED, That the Southern Baptist Convention, assembled in its ninety-sixth year in Birmingham, Alabama, do on this day, May 15, 1941, reaffirm its faith in the power of prayer and in the leadership of the Holy Spirit.	Be it RESOLVED, That with one accord we turn to Almighty God, through Christ his Son, in humble petition for the forgiveness of whatever measure of corporate guilt may be ours with regard to the present international conflict, and, that our nation, through repentance and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ may be so yielded to the Divine Plan, that we may be effectively used in helping to bring to the nations of the world a just and righteous peace.	Be it further RESOLVED, That we invite the membership of our churches and all Christian believers throughout the world, to pray daily at a given hour, both in public and in private places, to the end that such a ""just and righteous peace"" may be speedily achieved.  And,	Be it further RESOLVED, That as Christians we recognize that there may be honest differences of opinion about the issue in the present conflict, but we are deeply resolved that any difference shall not cause any breach in our fellowship.	Be it further RESOLVED, That the officers of this Convention constitute a committee which shall seek to carry out the spirit of this resolution, to lend itself to the advancement of such Christian ideals as should lead to the establishment and maintenance of a just and righteous peace; shall call our people everywhere in unceasing intercession, and that this committee be instructed to put this resolution into effect at once.	RESOLUTION VI	WHEREAS, The Southern Baptist Convention in session at Birmingham, May 16, 1941, affirmed its loyalty to the United States Government, and its devotion to the ideals of its founding fathers, and	WHEREAS, The aforesaid resolution [offered by Powhatan W. James] may be misinterpreted by some as a committal to the principle of militarism, Therefore, be it resolved that the aforesaid resolution, in no way commits the Southern Baptist Convention to an approval of war, as a recognized principle in settling international differences.

That in particular this principle would prohibit and should prohibit the levying of any tax by the government, by whatever name called, upon any church or religious or charitable institution under church auspices all of which are purely voluntary and must be kept entirely free from the taxing power and directing control of the government if freedom of religion is to continue.	4.

It is our conviction that a change of name by which a tax levied by the government is called a contribution, does not change the nature of the levy nor the principles involved.  Nor is the principle changed by the proposal to extend the coverage of the Social Security Act only to certain classes of persons employed by religious and charitable institutions.

"272","To the President of the United States,	Secretary of War, and the Secretary of the Navy.	We, the messengers of the Southern Baptist Convention, assembled in San Antonio, Texas, May 16-20, 1942, earnestly request that you give consideration to a matter which is of vital concern to all citizens.  We believe that the manufacture of alcoholic liquors and the sale of these beverages to the civilians and armed forces of our country, in this time of national crisis, seriously imperils the welfare and safety of the United States.	We wish to remind you that the consumption of intoxicants lowers the efficiency and lessens the skill of men who operate the complicated machinery and intricate weapons which are used for national defense.  Soldiers and sailors require alert minds and strong bodies while they endure the tremendous strain and ordeals of modern combat.  Liquor makes a weaker army because it lessens human efficiency and lowers the morale of the armed forces.	There are other facts which we offer for your consideration.  The Government has urged farmers to raise more grain to feed civilians, soldiers, and the unfortunate peoples abroad; yet it permits brewers and distillers to use annually one and three quarter million tons of grain for the manufacture of spirituous liquors.  And again, the Government, in spite of the prevailing shortage and rationing system, allows breweries and distilleries to purchase seventy percent of their peace-time consumption of sugar.  We believe that such essential products as grain and sugar ought to be used to better advantage in this hour of distress.	It is our opinion that the moral aspect of this question is of greatest importance.  Young men in uniforms lose their identity somewhat; thus they are more disposed to fall into temptations.  Every honest and legitimate means should be employed to protect these our sons, from the baneful, heartless, and hurtful effects of alcohol while they give sacrifical service for country and freedom.	We wish to protest against this sinister business which is so potent in lowering the morale and efficiency of the nation and which strikes with deadly effectiveness at the morality of the citizenry.  Especially do we ask for your sympathetic and effective aid in an effort to eliminate the sale of alcohol to the members of the armed forces of America.  To this end we petition that the proper authority in each branch of service issue an order which will stop the sale of all alcoholic beverages in army camps and naval bases and stations, and we request that local governments receive hearty encouragement as they seek to maintain a wholesome environment in the areas about the camps and bases.  We believe that such an order by you will save many of our sons and do much to strengthen our cause in this hour of emergency.	William Jennings Bryan, the idol of democracy, served only grape juice at social functions.  Josephus Daniels, as Secretary of the Navy, outlawed intoxicants from that branch of the service.  Woodrow Wilson approved war-time prohibition.  You have, therefore, the most distinguished precedents for the action which we ask at your hands.	We recommend that the President of this Convention appoint a committee of seven to present this memorial to the President of the United States, to the Secretary of War, and to the Secretary of the Navy, and that this committee be instructed to use proper methods during the year which will lead to the attainment of the objectives named in this memorial.	During the present year Baptist colleges have taken the lead under the direction of the Education Commission in assembling and transmitting information on problems of war and peace.  The Southern Baptist Convention last year in the annual meeting at San Antonio, Texas adopted the following resolution (note change in paragraph five in both resolutions):THE RESOLUTION	WHEREAS, Southern Baptists as loyal citizens of the United States are cooperating and participating in all branches of the present war, including the Army, the Navy, and the Air Corps, and	WHEREAS, The prosecution of the war for the maintenance, perpetuation and extension of our four freedoms, well known and enjoyed by American citizens in our constitutional democracy, may not accomplish the purposes for which it is fought unless a just and righteous peace follows the termination of the war, and	WHEREAS, It will be too late to make plans for a lasting peace if constructive and comprehensive plans are delayed until the conclusion of the war, and	WHEREAS, Our Baptist colleges and universities have on their faculties a number of renowned scholars in the fields of knowledge utterly necessary for making a worthy peace, and	WHEREAS, Three American statesmen who are in the highest ranking positions as chairmen of committees in the United States Senate, the treaty determining body of our Federal Government, Senator Tom Connally of Texas, Senator Walter F. George of Georgia, and Senator Josiah W. Bailey of North Carolina, being chairmen respectively of the Foreign Relations Committee, the Finance Committee, and the Commerce Committee, are graduates of our Baptist universities, Senator Connally of Baylor University, Senator George of Mercer University, and Senator Bailey of Wake Forest College,	Therefore be it RESOLVED, That the convention request the Education Commission to procure, assemble and transmit to our own three Christian statesmen a body of facts and principles involved in a Christian peace with the earnest hope that these facts and principles may be used in planning the new world order which may be in accordance with the sovereign will of God so that the paths of all mankind may ultimately be paths of peace.	RESOLUTION	WHEREAS, Southern Baptists as loyal citizens of the United States are cooperating and participating in all branches of the present war, including the Army, the Navy and the Air Corps, and,	WHEREAS, The prosecution of the war for the maintenance, perpetuation and extension of the four freedoms, well known and enjoyed by American citizens in our Constitutional Democracy, may not accomplish the purposes for which it is fought, unless a just and righteous peace follows the termination of the war, and	WHEREAS, It is too late to make plans for a lasting peace if constructive and comprehensive plans are delayed until the conclusion of the war, and	WHEREAS, Our Baptist Colleges and Universities have on their facilities a number of renowned scholars in the fields of knowledge utterly necessary for making a worthy peace, and,	WHEREAS, The two American Statesmen who are in the highest ranking positions in the United States Senate, the treaty determining body of our Federal Government, Senator Tom Connally of Texas and Senator Walter F. George of Georgia, being chairmen respectively of the Foreign Relations Committee and the Finance Committee, are both graduates of our Baptist Universities, Senator Connally of Baylor University and Senator George of Mercer University,	Therefore, Be it RESOLVED, That the Convention request the Education Commission to procure, assemble and transmit to our own two Christian Statesmen, and their colleagues, a body of facts and principles involved in a Christian peace with the earnest hope that these facts and principles may be used in planning the new world order which may be in accordance with the Sovereign will of God, so that the paths of all mankind may ultimately be the paths of peace.",1942

"275","The Church School of Missions Movement has resulted in some glorious achievements:	1.  The facts of missions have been set forth.	2.  Much needed information has been given in our people.	3.  The cause of world-wide Missions has been promoted.	4.  Our gifts to the Cooperative Program have greatly increased.	5.  Offerings to World Emergency Relief have multiplied many fold.	6.  Volunteers for our Mission fields have been secured.	7.  The spiritual life of our members has been deepened.	Regarding Missions today, Dr. Lattourett says truly:	Missions must be continued;	Retrenchment must cease;	Reinforcements must be sent;	Adequate funds must be secured.	Some states have undertaken to hold Schools of Missions in every Association in the state and the schools already held have achieved most gratifying results.  Many missionaries on enforced furlough are available at this time for this kind of work.	We, therefore, urgently recommend that Schools of Missions be conducted in every Association in every state as early as possible.	The Southwide and State organizations, together with our denominational press, are urgently requested to cooperate in this great movement.",1942

(2)  In view of the availability of beer and other alcoholic beverages in and about army posts, and the agitation now being carried on to permit the sale of beer on the ships of the Navy and in Navy yards, we recommend that the Convention reaffirm its opposition to the sale of alcoholic beverages in and around all Army and Navy posts, and protest against any movement to extend their availability to men aboard ships.	(3)  We recommend that we commend the studies of alcoholism being made in schools and colleges, both public and private, and urge full support of such enterprises as The Yale Institute of Alcohol Studies; and that we urge further that the educational approach be increasingly promoted in our churches, church schools, and denominational schools and colleges, looking toward the day when the sentiment and conviction of the nation will again banish the liquor traffic.

We voice our profound appreciation to the newspaper and News Agencies for the liberal, broad publicity they have given the Convention.  The coverage of the proceedings of the Convention in the daily columns of the papers has been liberal and exceptionally satisfactory.  The services of the Radios and commentators have rendered Southern Baptists a great and much appreciated service.	We further make special note of the efficient service of the hotels and eating places of the city for their efficient care, in the face of multiplied difficulties.  They have proved themselves competent and willing to care for a great Convention in this strategic hour when all such facilities are regularly crowded and taxed.",1944

"285","At the very moment when all Americans should be united for victory, we view with deepest regret and growing alarm the persistent campaign of the official circles of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States, to rid Latin America of Protestant missionaries.  It is contended that their presence is inimical to the best interests of the Good Neighbor Policy of our government.  An official statement by their Archbishops and Bishops declares Protestant missionary efforts ""prove to be a disturbing factor in our international relations,"" and are therefore ""offensive to the dignity of our Southern brothers.""  The April issue of a leading Catholic periodical characterizes the Protestant missionary enterprise as ""unnecessary, unwelcome, and unwise.""  It suggests that this work ""be curtailed.""  Such curtailment naturally involves governmental action.	This is a serious charge which the Southern Baptist Convention, representing five and one-half million American citizens, has borne patiently but now insists cannot go unanswered.  We do not question the right of anyone to attack the merits of our missionary enterprise on religious grounds.  That is the privilege of free men in a free America.  Nor is it our purpose to defend the work of some two hundred Southern Baptist missionaries who have labored side by side with patriotic Latin Americans in seven neighbor republics for over two generations.  Our record of transformed lives, schools, colleges, seminaries, training schools, goodwill centers, medical clinics, and independent Latin American Baptist Conventions speaks for itself.  Scores of Latin American business men, professional men, and government officials have repeatedly voiced their appreciation of this unselfish work.	The only vital issue here involved is the fundamental ideal of complete religious freedom, first exemplified in human history by the establishment of Rhode Island through the heroic efforts of the persecuted Baptist, Roger Williams.  This ideal was later incorporated in the First Amendment of the  Constitution of the United States, separating church and state.  For this freedom we are asking our Catholic, Jewish, Protestant, and non-religious men to fight and die today.  This is a right guaranteed by Latin American republics with full freedom to worship and propagate one's religious convictions.  Many of these nations have separation of church and state, notably Brazil, the largest of them all.  In spite of this attack on Protestant work, we herewith reassert our historic position to defend the full religious rights of our Catholic neighbors in the United States where they nominally constitute about fifteen percent of the total population, and to defend the religious rights of all minorities everywhere.  On the other hand, we likewise insist that those same God-given rights be granted where we constitute a minority, as in Latin America.	Since Latin American republics are outside active war zones, there has been no difficulty in securing the renewal or revalidation of passports for our experienced missionaries.  In this regard, our State Department, hard pressed with countless war problems, has shown every consideration.  However, in regard to the granting of passports to regularly appointed new missionaries, there has often been serious difficulty and delay during the war years.  This is verified by the Committee on Cooperation in Latin America, with headquarters in New York, representing a large number of Protestant mission boards.  Ordinarily, this might have been attributed to the war emergency, the lack of transportation, or the refusal of Latin American governments to grant the necessary entrance permits or visas.  Actually, transportation has been available; most Latin American governments have been ready and willing to grant the vises; and a Roman Catholic foreign mission official states:  ""We have had no difficulty in securing passports for our missioners.""  Happily, this situation is changing, and passports to new Protestant missionaries are being issued more readily.	We seek no governmental favors or special recognition, but we do maintain that in granting passports outside of war zones, it is not the prerogative of our State Department to pass on the individual merits of the professions of American citizens going abroad, as long as those professions are neither subversive nor immoral.  We would maintain the right of American missionaries to be considered as American citizens on legitimate business, regardless of any religious affiliation.  We claim the same right for American Catholic missioners, or the missionaries of all faiths.  Because of tremendous war problems many may consider this a minor issue, but in the light of the Second Freedom--Freedom of Religion--we consider it of major importance.  If we lose in this spiritual battle, the future of full religious freedom in the western hemisphere and the world may be imperiled.  We call on all American citizens and their elected representatives to be constantly on the alert against any tendency toward religious favoritism by our government.	It is recommended that copies of this resolution be forwarded to the State Department, Washington, D. C., to all senators and representatives within the territory of the Southern Baptist Convention, and to all Baptist state papers.",1944
"286","From time to time various amendments have been proposed to the Social Security Act some of which, if enacted in the law, would vitally affect the beliefs and time-honored practices of Baptists as well as people of other faiths.  From time to time the Southern Baptist Convention has had occasion to vigorously protest certain amendments to this Act.  Attention is called to a most important proposed change which, if enacted into law, will vitally affect Baptist churches and institutions throughout the land, and will be a marked advance on the part of the Government into religious affairs.  At the meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention held in San Antonio, Texas, in 1942, the Relief and Annuity Board had occasion to refer to then pending Social Security amendments in which the Convention was reminded of previous expression of views, made many times, against Government interference with the churches and agencies thereof.  In the report to the Convention at San Antonio it said:  ""Southern Baptists are practically of one mind in their objection to any amendments to the Social Security Act which would result in the taxing of their churches and the agencies of the churches.  Southern Baptists believe in the time-honored principle of the separation of church and state as guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution.  The Bible teaching on this question is kept constantly in mind, namely:  That Christian people are to 'render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.'""	The then pending amendments to the Social Security Act, in so far as they relate to the taxing of churches died in committee.	The question has again arisen in a most dangerous and subtle form.  There is now pending in Congress a bill styled:  H.R. 3204, 78th Congress, First Session, which provides that any tax exempt organization ""shall secure Federal old age and survivors insurance for its employees, and through such insurance provide for the payment of benefits to such employees, etc. . . .""  The Bill further provides, in substance, for the creation of a special fund for ""employees of religious, charitable, educational and certain other organizations,"" and levies a tax on all such organizations beginning with 1% through 1947, 1 1/2% through 1950, and thereafter 2%, and for a like contribution by the employees.  An elaborate set-up is provided for benefit payments, hearings, etc., with the right and power of the Board to issue subpoenas, investigate the records of the various churches and various institutions affected by the Act.	On the whole the Act has some very appealing features, and the wording thereof, as well as the argument which could be made in favor of its passage, is indeed very specious and thereby more dangerous.  The proponents of the Act, in an effort no doubt to head off as much opposition as possible, have incorporated a clause that service performed by a ""duly ordained . . . minister of any church in the regular exercise of his ministry, and service performed by regular members of religious orders in the exercise of duties assigned by such orders"" are not embraced within the term ""employment"" as used in the Act.  Those of us with any experience in our legislative history will see at once that this exemption of ministers while in the regular exercise of their ministry is of a temporary nature.  With other church and institutional employees such as secretaries, janitors, educational directors, teachers in colleges, etc., covered by the Act, it would be illogical and credulous to believe that ministers will be exempted very long.	The fundamental objection to the enactment of the proposed Extension of the Social Security Act, as well as any other of similar import, is that it permits the Federal Government to reach its hand into the affairs of local churches, and the various denominational agencies and institutions of our States, and of the Southern Baptist Convention.  Whenever any government is empowered to tax churches, or the agencies thereof, that government has thereby obtained the power to destroy.  If this power is ever granted, we are in extreme danger of seeing the destruction of our time-honored beliefs and traditions.  The granting of the power to the Government to tax churches in any way, or any form whatsoever, is the first step in the rapidly expanding tendency to centralization of Governmental power which will lead to but one thing so far as Baptists and Protestants are concerned, and that is the establishment of a State church.	We realize that our Nation faces dangers of a most unusual nature.  We are fighting for our National existence and our way of life.  The war has changed many things, some perhaps for better, and some for worse.  The Government has rightly insisted upon the subordination of everything to one object, the winning of the war.  Our people have loyally complied.  They have surrendered their individual rights, sacrificed their own interests and suppressed their own convictions in order that the Government might have a free hand in carrying on the war.  Generally speaking, where our people could not commend they have kept silent.  All of this is indubitable proof of our patriotism.  Such submission to Government authority in times of war should not signify that we have ceased to think for ourselves, nor should such submission indicate that we have forgotten our inalienable religious rights and privileges under our system of government, nor forbid us to protest their violation.	Now, whereas:	The foregoing statement emphasizes our need to reaffirm our opposition to any governmental interference with our religious work,	Therefore, be it RESOLVED that,	Faced as we are with the violation of what we believe to be our time-honored principles of the separation of church and state, we once more protest the passage of any Act, whether an amendment to the Social Security Act or other legislation, however speciously worded or in whatever form, which permits the Federal Government to lay its hand in any way, method or manner upon the affairs of our churches or our denominational agencies.  In making this protest we again assert that the church of Jesus Christ cannot subject itself to any outside control, nor bend to any Governmental authority; and that the right of civil and religious liberty, carrying with it the entire separation of Government in the affairs of religion, is, in the sight of God, the inalienable and indefeasible right of every Christian of whatever creed, color or race.  These rights are of priceless value, the adherence to which will not only preserve religious liberty but promote the civil well-being of all our people.",1944
"287","	The Executive Committee of the Southern Baptist Convention in session at Nashville, Tennessee, June 14, 1945, on motion of Dr. Louie D. Newton, Atlanta, Georgia, adopted this resolution and directed that it be printed following the American Bible Society Report in the 1945 Southern Baptist Annual:	Having received, on behalf of the Convention, the above report as information for our people, the Executive Committee of the Southern Baptist Convention reaffirms the former expressions of appreciation of the work of the American Bible Society, and fraternally urges the increased support of our people in the essentially unique and vital ministry of this cherished Society in printing and distributing the Holy Scriptures throughout the world.

Holloway as the Field Secretary of the Society, and to assure him and all the executives of the Society of our continuing prayers for the favor of our Lord upon their work.	RESOLUTION ON THE AMERICAN BIBLE SOCIETY	Louie D. Newton read the following resolution with reference to the American Bible Society, which was adopted:	WHEREAS, We believe that a nationwide emphasis on Bible reading is vitally needed in America today and that thoughtful reading of the Word of God will not only bring faith, hope, and courage to millions of people now tortured by doubt, uncertainty and fear, but such reading will also effectively serve to repair the moral character and spiritual ideals which form the necessary foundation for enduring democracy, and	WHEREAS, The hundreds of thousands of men and women in the Armed Forces and the multitudes at home who are turning to the Word of God now as never before, indicate that the time is ripe to magnify the place of the Bible in American life,	THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That	(1)  We commend the program now being developed by the American Bible Society for a great Nationwide Bible Reading from Thanksgiving to Christmas, in which the people at home and the members of the Armed Forces will join in the reading, one each day, of passages selected by a nationwide poll of pastors and chaplains as being most helpful for times like these.	(2)  Recognizing that the encouragement towards daily Bible reading which many people will receive from such a nationwide emphasis, will thereby facilitate our enlistment of these people in the long-established regular program of daily Bible reading in our various organizations, which programs we seek constantly to magnify and strengthen, we urge that our churches and all organizations of our denominational life shall make this special emphasis an integral part of our own program.	(3)  We request that our pastors, editors of publications and all general denominational leaders shall in every way possible give their aid to this nationwide emphasis on Bible reading which can be counted upon to create a spiritual bond between members of the Armed Services and the people at home that will be full of meaning for many families and make a priceless contribution to their hope and faith.",1945

Executive Committee, Page 41.		""That this Convention appoint a special committee on Evangelism representing all the cooperating states, to work with the Evangelistic Department of the Home Mission Board and leaders of our Sunday School Board in planning a great South-wide Evangelistic campaign for our Centennial year of 1945.  Machinery should be organized, covering the entire Convention, that would sponsor the ideal of at least one revival in every church throughout the South in 1945.  This committee would be instructed to call upon all agencies of the Convention and all State Boards to join in the promotion of this campaign.""  Evang. Com., Page 79	Pursuant to this authority Dr. J. B. Lawrence, Secretary of the Home Mission Board, after conferring with other denominational leaders, requested me to assume the responsibility of organizing and promoting this Crusade.	I sensed at once a call to one of the greatest opportunities for service that has ever come to me.	After considerable consultation with brethren and friends in all parts of the Convention territory, and after making it a matter of much prayer, I felt led to the Lord to say to Dr. Lawrence and the brethren that I would accept this responsibility on a temporary basis, provided the First Baptist Church of Shreveport, of which I have been pastor since April, 1912, approved.  Dr. Lawrence addressed a communication to the church presenting a request from the executive heads of all the Convention agencies that the church release me on leave of absence for this service.	After due consideration, and upon joint recommendation of the Boards of Deacons and Directors, the church voted unanimously to accede to this request, provided they should be allowed to continue the payment of my salary in order that our service might not be any charge to the denomination.	EXPENSES	The Home Board was requested by the Convention to sponsor the Crusade by providing the necessary expenses incident to its promotion.  Offices were set up in the First Baptist Church, Shreveport, without any charge.  One secretary with occasional extra help, has done all the work of the office.  Expenses of the Crusade have been kept to a minimum consistent with maximum service, which expenses the Home Board has generously and graciously provided.	ORGANIZATION	The Convention resolutions authorized the setting up of such organization as should be necessary to conduct the Crusade.  It was resolved, however, to utilize as far as possible existing organizations and have a very simple general organization, all of which should be on a volunteer basis.	By virtue of their office and in harmony with specific action of the Convention, Dr. J. B. Lawrence, Secretary of the Home Mission Board; Dr. T. L. Holcomb, Secretary of the Sunday School Board; Dr. W. H. Knight, Chairman of the Convention Committee on Evangelism, were designated as the General Staff who would map out the plans, policies and programs of the Crusade.  These brethren have rendered immeasurable and invaluable services in this regard.	I began active work on the Crusade in June, 1944, by first conferring with State Secretaries, State Editors, Convention Executives and Secretaries for suggestions and commitments of what they would and could do to promote the Crusade.  There was the warmest and most generous response.	After blocking out a rough draft of plans to be pursued, it was submitted by correspondence to leaders in every state for addition, amendment or subtraction.  A composite draft of plans was made from all these suggestions and submitted to some 300 leaders in a meeting at Ridgecrest, who gave a half day to discussions and proposals.  The plan that came out of all this was sent out as follows:	Plans and Programs	That the state organization should consist of, (1) the State Executive Secretary, (2) a State Director, (3) a State Convention Crusade Committee:	That the Associational organization should consist of, (1) the Moderator, (2) the Association or City Missionary, (3) an Associational Crusade Committee:	That the Church organization should consist of, (1) the pastor, associate pastor and staff, (2) the Church Crusade Committee, (3) a band of personal soul-winners as prayer partners (Matt. 18:19), and working partners to go two-by-two (Mark 6:7).	Calendar	JANUARY and FEBRUARY of the Centennial year were designated as preparatory months, (1) by taking a religious census, (2) by conducting all-church schools of evangelism, (3) by holding special seasons of contrition, confession, consecration and prayer.	MARCH and APRIL were designated as a period for city-wide simultaneous crusades with the object of having at least 100 such crusades.	MAY and JUNE were designated as months for meetings in the one-church towns and communities.	JULY, AUGUST and SEPTEMBER were designated as the time for rural crusades and 15,000 extension meetings.	OCTOBER and NOVEMBER were designated as a period for a second meeting in at least 10,000 churches, and for meetings in churches which had not found it convenient to hold a special crusade previously.	DECEMBER was designated as a time for enlistment of all old and new members in support of all the work of the church and denomination.	This program contemplated at least 50,000 individual evangelistic Crusades.	In addition to these, Dr. Homer L. Grice, Director of Vacation Bible Schools, set up a program for 10,000 schools with an objective of winning 50,000 children to Christ.	The 1,064 Southern Baptist Chaplains, serving our armed forces, accepted a goal of 100,000 to win to Christ during the centennial year.  The Sunday School forces, the Brotherhoods, W.M.U.'s, the Training Unions, Baptist Student Union were all requested to render special service, and responded with alacrity and have cooperated thoroughly.	Promotion	In promoting this Crusade, 25,000 general letters were sent to all pastors and denominational workers, associational, statewide and south-wide.	Sixty thousand copies of a ""Two Win One"" folder were printed in two colors and distributed to pastors and others who occupy positions of responsibility and leadership in church or denomination.	Fifty thousand copies of an 84-page ""Two Win One"" booklet giving information, instruction and inspiration on every phase of evangelistic work and relating it to this Crusade have been printed and distributed.	More than a thousand personal letters have been written to individual leaders regarding various phases of the Crusade.	More than 100 articles containing upwards of 100,000 words have been written for various denominational papers, journals and magazines.	Fifty thousand copies of the tract ""The Spirit Filled Life"" were distributed to pastors and leaders.  Orders for 500,000 copies of the Gospel of John have been placed and are being distributed.  These are provided by volunteer gifts.  We hope to be able to distribute 500,000 more before the end of the year.	I have traveled more than 30,000 miles in all states, except two, from Baltimore to Los Angeles (difficult as travel is in these days) to confer with pastors' conferences and denominational leaders, and to address groups of workers from all departments of our denominational work, state conventions and mass meetings, having addressed some 200,000 of our people face to face and spoken to millions of others on the radio.	During the spring I directed six city-wide crusades and am scheduled for two others during October.  During the summer I am scheduled to conduct four individual church meetings, one of which is in a remote rural district.	Never in my forty years of denominational interest and activity have I seen Southern Baptists more united, more hearty, more enthusiastic or more cooperative than under this Centennial Evangelistic Crusade.  This indicates that Southern Baptists are, as they always have been, evangelical in faith and evangelistic in fidelity.	We would make grateful acknowledgment of the generous and gracious cooperation which all the denominational executives, agencies, institutions and departmental heads have given to the Centennial Evangelistic Crusade.	Reports on results at the present moment are incomplete and inadequate, but the general trend on evangelism is definitely upward and there are many indications of unusual achievements.  One village church in Louisiana, which had a goal of 50, reached that goal on March 10, and is still evangelizing and baptizing.  A large city church in Tennessee, which baptized 70 last year, had baptized 165 by March 15 of this year.  A church in Virginia, under the ministry of the State Director, baptized twice as many in ten days as they baptized last year.  A city-wide simultaneous crusade in Texas had as many baptisms during that period as they had last year.  The Associational Minutes for 1944 show an increase of more than 1,600 baptisms over 1943.	Similar reports are coming from all sections of Convention territory.  We are grateful for these mercy drops which are falling but for the showers we shall continue to pray.	Records reveal that evangelism has its hardest time during a war period.  This is probably due to the fact that evangelism is the highest expression of spiritual idealism, while war is the deepest expression of materialistic humanism.  Further:  Records reveal that evangelism surges upward following war periods.  If we do well, therefore, during this war period and keep the fires of evangelism aglow, we may reasonably and expectantly hope for a brilliant, blazing forth of evangelistic zeal and results at the end of this war.	To this end the Home Mission Board has elected a secretary of evangelism in the person of Rev. J. Fred Eastham, who is cooperating fully in the present crusade and will carry on a continuous evangelistic program following the temporary period of the Centennial Evangelistic Crusade.	Evangelism is the proclamation of the good news in Jesus Christ, with a view to winning others to faith in Him as a personal Saviour and fidelity in Him as Lord and Master.	To this task Southern Baptists are committed by the law under which they operate, by the faith which they profess, by the history which they have made and by the future to which they look, until Jesus comes.",1945

"298","PREAMBLE	From time to time through all our modern history, Baptists have declared their principles which define their meaning and mission in relation to the gospel and in relation to the world.  Surely, now when the world is writing in terrific crisis we are under obligation to restate our principles, to make clear that our faith is good news for all mankind.  It is with this sense of obligation and with this purpose that the Southern Baptist Convention, at its Centennial meeting, undertakes to state afresh the basic principles that we must proclaim to the whole world in our day.	PRINCIPLES	Our distinctive belief is our Doctrine of Man in the personal order of life, that is, what God says concerning man.	(1)  God places infinite and eternal value on the individual man and makes him the focal unit in all His dealings with mankind.	(2)  Every man is endowed by the Creator with competence as a person to deal with God and with his fellowmen in all rightful relations.	(3)  God gives to the individual man natural, inalienable rights and privileges which should be recognized in human society.  These rights should not be violated by compulsion or by undue constraint or restraint so as in any wise to interfere with the individual's free functioning as a unit in all relationships.	(4)  Man consequently has supreme and compelling responsibility under God for the full realization of his possibilities as a human being, for seeking and receiving fellowship with God, and for fulfilling the purposes of God in all human relations.  To the end of this divine economy for humanity, God has provided in the gospel of Christ, through the power of the Holy Spirit, for the renewal of the individual soul by regeneration and for its response through the grace of God to the divine ideal.	Out of this doctrine of the individual grows the Baptist conviction concerning all aspects of religious experienced and life.	First, this religious experience of regeneration and conversion is the beginning of the Christian life and is prerequisite to church membership.	Second, the local church, a voluntary fellowship of baptized believers, is responsible directly and only to Christ, the Creator and Head of the church.  It is a democratic body in which all the members are equally free and responsible participants.  Its divinely called ministry is chosen by the church itself under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.	Third, the one and only authority in faith and practice is the New Testament as the divinely inspired record and interpretation of the supreme revelation of God through Jesus Christ as Redeemer, Saviour and Lord.	Fourth, this basic belief demands the separation of church and state.  Each must be left free to serve in its own divinely appointed sphere for the welfare of mankind; but neither undertaking to control the other or to be supported as such by the other.	Fifth, the comprehensive statement of all these doctrines is contained in our insistence upon religious liberty.  By this we mean, and must mean, not only freedom of individual worship and fellowship without interference by the state; but we mean also specifically and insistently the right of propaganda through evangelism, education, and the development of Christian institutions.  This we claim not as for ourselves, but for all men of all religious beliefs and of all theories of social order which are not obviously immoral or detrimental to the common welfare of men; and we demand this not as a concession or toleration, but as a basic right under God.	FIELDS OF APPLICATION	These basic principles find the spheres of their operation in all the principal concerns of humanity.  The Christian movement is not isolated from the common concerns and life of mankind, but as a declarative, prophetic movement charged with a gospel for men in all relations, is a leavening and instructing agency in the midst of society for the good of the human race and the glory of God in the coming of His Kingdom.	(1)  To this comprehensive end, Christians are under obligation to seek for true Christian unity in experience and spiritual fellowship; and for the voluntary cooperation of all Christian believers in the total work for which the gospel is designed.  This cooperation should not issue in any ecclesiastical overlordship of the individually redeemed or their churches.	(2)  Recognizing the divine sovereignty over all the people of the world, we must do all possible to prevent the organization of the world on the principles of materialism, selfish nationalism, arrogant imperialism and power politics; but rather insist upon the principles of the oneness of humanity, the rights of all men alike under God, and the Christian ideals of brotherhood, justice and truth, remembering that God's supreme word for the organized life of humanity is righteousness.	(3)  To this end it is necessary to resist all inequalities of basic rights and privileges in the church and in society, which arise out of racial prides and prejudices, economic greed, and class distinctions; everywhere proclaiming and practicing human brotherhood under the will and purpose of God.	(4)  Our Christian faith repudiates and opposes all forms of exploitation, manipulation or neglect and indifference on the part of any section of our human race by any other section on any and every pretext whatsoever.  The Christian religion lies at the base of all.  In it alone is there hope of the application of these principles in other relations of men.	It is especially urgent therefore, at this time, that these principles should be recognized when we are face to face with the necessity for the reconstruction, the rehabilitation and the reorientation of the lives of all peoples and the corporate life of humanity.  Upon the Christian forces lies the responsibility for introducing now the gospel, the purpose and the power of God unto salvation for all men.	There can be a Christian order only as it is constituted of and by genuine Christians.  Neither the world nor any part of the world can be organized and conducted on Christian principles except as there are Christians incorporating these principles.  Here lies the imperative for an immediate undertaking for worldwide and thorough evangelizing of all peoples.  Christian missions must be comprehensive, thorough and universal.  New men are essential to a new world.	The preceding report submitted by the Committee on Statement of Principles:L.L. Gwaltney, Alabama				Norman W. Cox, MississippiH.A. Zimmerman, Arizona			B.

TAYLOR'S 	APPOINTMENT TO THE VATICAN, AND CALL THE VATICAN EMBASSY HOME	WHEREAS, Southern Baptists, in regular convention assembled, beginning at Baltimore, in 1940, have repeatedly and earnestly protested the action of the President of the United States in appointing Mr. Myron C. Taylor as his ""Personal Representative"" to the Vatican, December 26, 1939, without the consent or approval of the Congress, and in violation of the First Amendment to the Constitution, and the Act of the 39th Congress, 1867, forbidding any further appropriation of money ""hereby or otherwise"" for the support of an American legation at Rome (meaning the Vatican), and,	WHEREAS, This unauthorized and unfortunate and untimely appointment has stimulated and nourished deep anxiety and concern amongst the freedom-loving people in every section of our Nation at a time when we so much desire and need a unified people, and	WHEREAS, The U.

Embassy staff at the Vatican has been steadily increased, notably following the surrender of Germany, costing the taxpayers approximately $40,000 during the past year, and,	WHEREAS, Our Government in further violation of the Constitution of the United States (See Article I, Section 9) allowed Mr. Taylor to accept the Grand Cross of the Order of Pius, carrying with it the hereditary status of a papal nobleman (See story in New York Times, dated Vatican City, March 11, 1946), and,	WHEREAS, The President of the United States has recently made official announcement of the return of Mr. Taylor to the Vatican as the representative of the President of the United States, with the rank of Ambassador, thus implying an indefinite, and, perhaps, a permanent official representative of our Government at the Vatican, without the consent or approval of the Congress, and in violation of the First Amendment to the Constitution, and other provisions of the Constitution and Acts of the Congress, therefore,	Be it RESOLVED, By the messengers of the Southern Baptist Convention, in session this the 16th day of May, 1946, in Miami, Florida,	First, that we do most earnestly and respectfully protest this unauthorized and unfortunate procedure on the part of our Government, and, further, that we again petition the President of the United States to immediately terminate the appointment of Mr. Taylor, and call home the Embassy stafff at the Vatican, and,	Second, that the President of this Convention be authorized and requested to seek immediate conference with the President of the United States and personally present to him this protest and petition, and	Third, that we do hereby further authorize and request the President of this Convention to associate with him other officers of this Convention and other members of this Convention, if such course be found wise and expedient, in making this representation to the President of the United States, and,	Fourth, that we do hereby authorize and request the President of this Convention to associate himself with spokesmen of other evangelical bodies who have sought or shall seek such approach to the President of the United States in protest of this violation of the Constitution, and this unauthorized and unfortunate disregard of the cherished principle of religious liberty and its inevitable corollary, the complete separation of church and state, and	Fifth, that we, the members of the Executive Committee of the Southern Baptist Convention, in session, this the 15th day of May, 1946, in Miami, Florida, do hereby recommend to the Convention that this action be adopted.

"302","Regarding the resolutions presented by Dr. Walter L. Johnson of Mississippi and a Committee of the Baptist Pastors Conference of Richmond, your Committee finds that in general they cover parallel and largely similar problems and proposals.  They deal with relationships existing between our denominational agencies and within the organizational structure of the auxiliary organizations of our churches and their field of work, teaching and objectives.  Your Committee makes the following observations and recommendations:	First, It is obvious that there has developed duplications, overlapping and in some respects too much organization in our churches wherein the same groups belong to different organizations who do the same work.	Second, Inasmuch as the agencies have gradually evolved through the last fifty years their program and methods independently of each other we, your Committee, recommend that a Committee of fifteen be created by this Convention to carefully study the organizational needs of our churches with respect to their auxiliaries; to define the functions and spheres of each; to propose in the light of our experience and need what changes or additions should be made and to report to the 1947 session of the Southern Baptist Convention their findings and recommendations.  It is the hope of your Committee that the Committee to be appointed shall be led of the Holy Spirit to find a way whereby every good thing we have shall be conserved and such changes made that will enable our churches to evangelize, teach, train, instruct, enlist, and make more effective our entire stewardship of life and substance in the service of Christ.	Third, That the work of this Committee include that of study and recommendations concerning the utilization of principles and methods in the field of Religious Education in our churches and whole mission program.

Head, Roland Q. Leavell, and Louie D. Newton, plus six pastors to be named by the Committee on Committees.	Fifth, We suggest that the first three named be a steering committee to make all necessary preliminary study of this proposal between now and October 1, 1946, and that the full Committee begin its work following that date.	Sixth, That the Committee hereby created be instructed to publish their report in the denominational press not later than April 1, 1947.

RECOMMENDATION CONCERNING THE WORK OF THE SOCIAL SERVICE COMMISSION	(not a Resolution--adopted)	Since through the years the Social Service Commission has had a general function in the field of public morality and social problems and we have come upon a time when these problems are multiplying and the organization of convention agencies is undergoing changes in the interest of efficiency, we recommend that the Executive Committee, through a sub-committee and in conference with representatives of the Social Service Commission, be requested to restudy the proper functions of such a Commission for our time and to set out more clearly the scope of its work, in order	(1)  that the Convention may be asked to approve a more adequate service in this field than it has hitherto undertaken,	(2)  that the Commission itself may have warrant and guidance in projecting a definite program of service, and	(3)  that the measure of the support allocated to the Commission may be more accurately arrived at.",1946
"303","	The liquor traffic from 1942 to 1945 has greatly increased its revenues.  Its income increased from $3,700,000,000 in 1942 to $7,770,000,000 in 1945.  During 1946 it realized a profit of $164,000,000.  Per capita consumption of alcoholic beverages has registered an increase from 1.69 gallons per capita in 1943 to 20.67 gallons per capita in 1945.	There is no doubt that this increase of drinking, particularly among young people and women, has been greatly stimulated by a campaign of advertising which has become increasingly offensive to Christian people.  Today, the brewers are even running a series, ""Home Life in America,"" creating the false impression that beer is a part of the life of the American home, to teach mothers to serve their own children and their children's friends a beverage that for at least a percentage of them will lead to alcoholism.	Legislation is now before Congress proposing to close the channels of radio and of interstate commerce to such advertising.	We recommend, therefore, that this Convention go on record as supporting this proposed legislation (known as the Capper Bill, Senate Bill 265) and authorize the Public Relations Committee to make use of the action of the Convention at the public hearings on the bill.

The diplomacy of demand must be accompanied by the diplomacy of friendliness and just and aggressive proposals for the well-being of all nations.  We urge against all military policies that would, by becoming fixed patterns in our national structure, militarize the thinking and outlook of our people.  We urge that in the diplomatic procedure of our government the voices, not only of military men, but of the scientists, educators, economists and spiritual leaders of the nation be heard.

"327","(not a Resolution)	First:  RESOLVED that, because local Baptist churches are independent in nature, they may be organized by Baptists anywhere with or without reference to grievances of other Baptist churches, or any other religious body.

Second:  RESOLVED that, because of the voluntary principles that prevail, churches, associations, and state conventions of Baptists may cooperate with whomsoever they will, irrespective of geographical location.	Third:  RESOLVED that, because of moral-interdependence of Baptist bodies, cooperation should take place wherever possible between all Baptist individuals, churches, associations, and conventions.  The general denominational bodies, furthermore, should themselves strive for mutual good will and understanding.  This does not mean deviation from conviction, but recognizes that the Christian task is larger than any segment of its followers.	The application of these principles as set out in the foregoing three resolutions, as a matter of fact, have already been exhibited in the acceptance by the Southern Baptist Convention, meeting in San Antonio in 1942, of Baptists in California and at Memphis in 1948, of Baptists in Kansas.

As our fathers shed their blood to secure for all our people the ideal of the separation of church and state, so today we pledge 'our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor' to preserve inviolate these freedoms.	""Accordingly, the Southern Baptist Convention, in its one hundred fifth year, composed of messengers from 27,285 churches in twenty-two states of the nation and the District of Columbia, embracing a total membership of 6,761,265, assembled in the city of Chicago, Illinois, this eleventh day of May, 1950, gives expression to the following resolution:	""WHEREAS, The Senate Finance Committee, considering, these many weeks past, the House-passed social security revision bill HR 6000, and agreeing to cover employees of non-profit organizations, has stipulated 'except that all employees of religious denominations and of organizations owned or controlled by a religious denomination would continue to be excluded from coverage,' permitting any denomination, desiring to do so, to participate on a voluntary basis; and	""WHEREAS, It is generally understood that this decision was reached by the Committee because the issue basically was deemed to be one of continued separation of church and state, a matter on which Southern Baptists have expressed themselves again and again, the basis upon which Southern Baptists laid their petition before said Committee, February 20, last;	""Now, therefore, be it RESOLVED, That this Convention instruct its corresponding secretary:	(1)  To express the deep and sincere appreciation of all Southern Baptists to the Senate Finance Committee:  for the courteous hearing accorded our representative, Dr. Walter R. Alexander, executive secretary, Relief and Annuity Board of the Southern Baptist Convention, February 20, 1950; for their most painstaking study of this important issue with its many involvements; and for their evident respect for the convictions of certain religious groups, Southern Baptists among them, in continuing to exclude from mandatory social security coverage lay employees of religious denominations and of organizations owned and controlled by a religious denomination.	(2)  To petition the Senate of the United States in its deliberations on the report of the Senate Finance Committee with regard to extended coverage of Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, to preserve this exclusion of all employees of religious denominations and of organizations owned or controlled by a religious denomination.	""In this connection we respectfully submit the following statement:Southern Baptists believe in social security for the American people.  They have advocated it for many years.  Sufficient evidence of that fact are the retirement plans they operate, offering coverage to every salaried employee of the denomination, without regard to race, sex, age or type of service rendered, and whether ordained or lay, which plans offer more substantial coverage, more adequate protection and larger age annuities than are provided under Federal Social Security.	'Southern Baptists believe also in the absolute separation of church and state.  It should be noted here that H.R. Bill 6000 makes an interesting and appreciated concession.  It calls for contributions by employees of non-profit organizations on a compulsory basis, permitting contributions made by the employer to be on a voluntary basis.  To many people, this provision may appear to keep well defined that line of demarcation between church and state.  In its practical application, however, it remains our conviction this would not be the case.  There would soon be brought to bear upon non-participating employers a series of pressures--pressures that would intensify rather than diminish as the years pass.  The demands of employees would be one such pressure; public opinion, another; and, sooner or later, the pressure of governmental authority.  Participation upon the part of the employer would cease to be voluntary, except in theory, for such pressure would become practically coercive.	'If not coercive, the employer might choose not to pay the employer's share of the tax; thus, the benefits accuring to the employee under the Bill would be greatly reduced, for the Bill further stipulates that, ""If the employer does not elect to pay the employer's contribution, only one-half of the employee's wages will be credited toward benefits.	If, on the other hand, such pressure upon the employer becomes coercive, the rights of free men, guaranteed under the First Amendment are abridged.	'Thus, we fear the possible and probable results of the option offered in the Senate Finance Committee's report extended to any denomination that would seek the coverage of Federal Social Security for its employees.  Such inclusion, even though not mandatory, would mean:  (1) that, in the future, the function of providing for the economic security of employees of churches, denominational organizations, and other institutions of religion would be taken away from these groups and be made the function of the State; (2) that the churches and their institutions would be taxed by the State for the support of its social security program: (3) that the door would be open for the punitive coercion of the churches by the State in the enforcement of its regulations; and (4) it involves the individual workers of the churches in a direct economic dependence upon the State that will tend to dull religious conviction and stifle independent, conscientious action.	'It is our conviction that the church's highest spiritual function becomes impossible when its organization and methods, to any degree whatsoever, are controlled by the State or when it becomes economically dependent upon any other group.  The church must remain entirely free from entangling alliances if it is to continue to function as the voice of God in human society'.""",1950

"371","Since the resolution offered by James M. Bullman (N.C.) raises the question of the relation of the Southern Baptist Convention to local churches and other Baptist bodies, and refers in part to a previous action of this Convention on this vital principle, we recommend that this Convention reaffirm the full statement referred to in the resolution, adopted in 1928, as recorded on pages 32-33, 1928 Annual, entitled ""Relation of Southern Baptist Convention to other Baptist Bodies.""	RELATION OF SOUTHERN BAPTIST CONVENTION	TO OTHER BAPTIST BODIES	According to instructions of the Convention, we submit the following statement of principles:	The relations between this Convention and other Baptist bodies can be understood in the light of a few basic New Testament principles, as follows:	The primary and fundamental principle is the direct relation of the individual soul to Jesus Christ as Saviour and Lord.  To his own Master every Christian stands or falls.	All Christian relationships are free and voluntary.  To become a Christian is not to be coerced into obedience to Christ, but to choose him voluntarily and freely.  Christ's authority is accepted as final for the believer in all things when he is thus chosen freely as Lord and Saviour.	The relations of the believer with other Christians are also free and voluntary and subject only to the authority of Jesus Christ.	A church of Christ is a free and voluntary association of believers, in his name, in obedience to his command, and for the carrying out of his purposes.	It follows that each church is autonomous or self-determining in all matters pertaining to its own life and activities.  It is not subject to any other church or organization of any kind whatsoever, but only to Christ and his authority.	All Baptist general bodies are voluntary organizations, established by individuals who wish to cooperate for some common end or ends in the kingdom of God.  This Convention is not an ecclesiastical body composed of churches, nor a federal body composed of state conventions.  Churches may seek to fulfill their obligation to extend Christ's kingdom by cooperating with these general organizations, but always on a purely voluntary basis, and without surrendering in any way or degree their right of self-determination.  These associations, unions, or conventions vary greatly in form, in size, in purpose, in territorial extent and in conditions of membership.  But they are all similar to churches in the fundamental principle of their organization and life in that each is independent of all others in its own work, free fraternal, autonomous, or self-determining in its sphere and activities.	The principle of cooperation between individuals and churches and general bodies in pursuit of great common ends is also a basic teaching of the gospel.  In all cooperative endeavor the principle of autonomy or self-determination should be carefully conserved.	There is no relation of superiority and inferiority among Baptist general bodies.  All are equal.  All make their appeal directly to individuals and churches.  Each determines its own objectives--financial or otherwise--and allocates its own funds to the interests promoted by it.  Each defines and fixes its own sphere of activities.  But all is done with due consideration and regard for the functions of other Baptist bodies.	The powers of Baptist general bodies are never legislative, but always advisory in their relations to churches, and to each other.	The cooperation of Baptist general bodies with each other may be desirable from time to time for the sake of greater economy and efficiency.  But there are dangers connected with such cooperation due to misunderstanding, confusion of thinking, and sometimes to trespassing upon the rights of cooperating bodies by one or other of the parties to the arrangement.	One of the present danger points is the cooperative relations between the Southern Baptist Convention and the various state conventions.  This Convention disclaims all authority over any state convention, but wishes to define its own functions and activities in relation to state bodies.  The following points should be stressed:	(1)  The cooperative relations between this Convention and state bodies as now established are limited to the one matter of collecting funds for Southwide and state objects in conjunction with a unified appeal for the objects.  The state convention boards are at present recognized by this Convention as collecting agencies for Southwide as well as for state funds.  This arrangement, however, is not an essential in Baptist organization, but is made simply as a matter of convenience and economy, and may be changed at any time.	(2)  The fact that the state bodies first handle the funds and are more directly related to the churches in the matter of collections does not alter the basic relations involved.  For the practical ends in view this Convention cooperates in the unified appeal for funds through state agencies.  But in principle it retains as inalienable and inherent the right to direct appeal to the churches.  Furthermore, in all matters other than money raising it retains complete control of its own affairs, with the right to fix its own objectives and to determine the amounts of money allocated to its various objects.	(3)  The power of appointing the members of all committees and boards of this Convention resides in the Convention itself.  When it is desirable that states, as such, or other territorial subdivisions of this Convention's area, be represented on the boards or committees of this Convention, this arrangement can easily be effected by consultation with the respective groups involved.  But the power to appoint directly or to nominate the members of its own committees and boards must be retained.	(4)  The practice of careful discrimination and mutual respect as between the state bodies and this Convention is called for.  The main functions of this Convention and of state bodies remain inviolable.  Neither body may impose its will upon the other in any manner or degree at any time.  Conference and discussion between committees of the respective groups are always proper in regard to matters involved in joint effort and in so far as necessary to promote good will and mutual understanding.  As the work is at present conducted such matters are the division of funds into state and Southwide, ways and means of promoting interest in the various causes, and the burden of cost of collections to be apportioned to state and Southwide funds.  These are all matters involved in the one matter of joint effort; viz., the collection of money.  In all other matters this Convention pursues its own objects in its own way.  It has no authority to allocate funds or to divert funds from any object included in a state budget.  In like manner no state body has any authority to allocate funds or to divert them from any object included in the Southwide budget.	(5)  The observance of the above principles by this Convention and by state bodies is essential to the integrity and perpetuity of this Convention.  Unless the Southern Baptist Convention insists upon its own autonomy in all phases of its own work a process of disintegration, loss of power and initiative, and gradual decline is inevitable.	(6)  It is important that the Executive Committee of this Convention receive instructions to conduct all negotiations with representatives of state or other bodies necessary to clarify relations and bring about a satisfactory adjustment, with a view to complete and hearty cooperation in all matters of common interest.",1956
"372","Inasmuch as the greatest source of primary historical resource materials that concern our churches is in their minutes and other records; and	Inasmuch as these valuable materials are subject to loss from a variety of reasons such as fire, careless handling, etc.; and	Inasmuch as in their present situation they are available to historians and others doing historical research only by traveling to the individual churches; and	Inasmuch as the Historical Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention is prepared to microfilm them at a very nominal cost and thereby to protect them perpetually from loss, make them more serviceable to the use of the churches, and to make prints available to libraries and research students;	THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SOUTHERN BAPTIST CONVENTION IN SESSION NOW ASSEMBLED:  That the said Convention request the churches to have their minutes and other vital records microfilmed by the Historical Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention.",1956

The Committee wishes to report that since all Southern Baptist Convention seminaries, in Christian principles of love and farsighted policies, have long welcomed qualified students of every race and nation, that this item is already satisfactorily fulfilled.	Item 2.  Motion:  ""That we request our state Baptist conventions to encourage their colleges to welcome the admittance of qualified students regardless of race.""  The committee wishes to report that since Southern Baptist Convention has no authority over institutions belonging to our state Baptist conventions and since the control and policies of these institutions, in accordance with Baptist principles of autonomy, of necessity, has to be left in their province, the Committee feels that the Southern Baptist Convention has no authority in this matter except by example.	Item 3.  Motion:  ""That we appoint a committee to study the possibilities of closer fellowship and eventual unity with fellow Baptists in our country.""  The committee rejoices to report that the following fraternal committees and movements are already in effect:	(1)   The Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs.	(2)   The Joint Baptist Jubilee Advance Committee.	(3) 	A joint meeting at Atlantic City of seven major Baptist bodies in America already planned for 1964 to celebrate the third Jubilee of Baptists in America organized for missions.	(4)   A committee on Canadian Baptist Cooperation.	(5)  	A vital part in Baptist World Alliance, which provides opportunity for cooperation among Baptist bodies of the world.	The committee feels that Item 3 is already being accomplished.	The committee respectfully requests that our people pray for God's guidance about other ways of expressing a spirit of brotherliness with other Baptist bodies.	Item 4.  Motion:  ""That we appoint a committee to study ways and means for a vital, useful, and constructive relationship to other Protestant bodies of Christians in our country and around the world.""	WHEREAS, A great amount of co-operation with other Christian bodies is already in effect in local churches, in pastors' associations, in temperance endeavors, religious surveys, in campaigns against vice and social evils, and the like; and	WHEREAS, An effective all-out Christian witness is needed to counteract world communism in the crises of this atomic age; therefore,	BE IT RESOLVED, That we encourage our Baptist people as individuals to think, and pray (during the next year) about additional ways and means of brotherly cooperation with other Christian bodies in matters of mutual concern wherein the sacrifice of cherished principles is not involved.",1961

"402","This Convention in years past has expressed itself clearly and positively on issues related to race relations.  Today the solution of the race problem is a major challenge to Christian faith and action at home and abroad.	Because Southern Baptists are the largest Christian group in the area where racial tensions between whites and Negroes are most acute, we feel an especially keen sense of Christian responsibility in this hour.	We recognize that members of our churches have sincere differences of opinion as to the best course of action in this matter.  On solid scriptural grounds, however, we reject mob violence as an attempted means of solving this problem.  We believe that both lawless violence on one hand and unwarranted provocation on the other are outside the demands of Christ upon us all.	We believe that the race problem is a moral and spiritual as well as social problem.  Southern Baptists accept the teachings of the Bible and the Commission of Christ as our sole guide of faith and practice in this area as in every other area.  We cannot afford to let pride or prejudice undermine . . . either our Christian witness at home or the years of consecrated, sacrificial missionary service among all the peoples of the world.

"415","WHEREAS, In the ebb and flow of God's provident dealings with Southern Baptists during the 118 years of their organized efforts in the ""eliciting, combining, and directing"" of human endeavor to promote the gospel of Jesus Christ as they interpret it, there have occurred epochs of problem and opportunity demanding a particular type and quality of interpretation and leadership, and	WHEREAS, We believe the two-year period culminating in this Convention has been one calling for the wisest, ablest, and most statesmanlike leadership available, and	WHEREAS, Confident that the leadership of the Holy Spirit has been manifest in the prayers we have made in seeking to resolve uncertainties, tensions, and divisions of opinion that have arisen to test our faith and our fellowship, and	WHEREAS, In conformity with our basic beliefs in Baptist principle and polity, and without the slightest assumption of ecclesiastical or administrative authority, we have been blessed for the past two years with a presidential leadership unexcelled by any previous occupant of the office, and	WHEREAS, In such presidential leadership God has provided our Convention fellowship with a man whose Christian faith, ministry, experience, scholarship, fearlessness, wisdom, tact, diplomacy, fairness, and unswerving devotion to the Word of God and the responsibilities of the churches in their trusteeship of the gospel, and	WHEREAS, We recognize the personal self-denial and dedication involved in the more than 200,000 miles traveled, the mission fields visited, the sermons and addresses delivered, the articles written, the conferences held, the committee meetings attended, the correspondence carried on, and the bone-wearying hours of labor expended in multitudinous ways on the part of our president, and	WHEREAS, We feel a particular gratitude for the wisdom, scholarship interpretation, guidance, and direction provided the last two Conventions in the presidential addresses, and	WHEREAS, We recognize the extreme demands our Convention has made on the First Baptist Church of Oklahoma City by taking its pastor away from his pastoral privileges and ministries for nearly three-fourths of the time,	THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED:	First, that we express our conviction that God has given Southern Baptists the presidental leadership of these last two years as we ""come to the Kingdom for such a time as this"" and that we humbly and gratefully thank him for giving us our president, Dr. Herschel Harold Hobbs.",1963

"417","The 1962 session of the Southern Baptist Convention, meeting in San Francisco, California, adopted the following motion:		""Since the report of the Committee on Statement of Baptist Faith and Message was adopted in 1925, there have been various statements from time to time which have been made, but no over-all statement which might be helpful at this time as suggested in Section 2 of that report, or introductory statement which might be used as an interpretation of the 1925 Statement.		""We recommend, therefore, that the president of this Convention be requested to call a meeting of the men now serving as presidents of the various state conventions that would qualify as a member of the Southern Baptist Convention committee under Bylaw 18 to present to the Convention in Kansas City some similar statement which shall serve as information to the churches, and which may serve as guidelines to the various agencies of the Southern Baptist Convention.  It is understood that any group or individuals may approach this committee to be of service.  The expenses of this committee shall be borne by the Convention Operating Budget.""	Your committee thus constituted begs leave to present its report as follows:	Throughout its work your committee has been conscious of the contribution made by the statement of ""The Baptist Faith and Message"" adopted by the Southern Baptist Convention in 1925.  It quotes with approval its affirmation that ""Christianity is supernatural in its origin and history.  We repudiate every theory of religion which denies the supernatural elements in our faith.""	Furthermore, it concurs in the introductory ""statement of the historic Baptist conception of the nature and function of confessions of faith in our religious and denominational life . . . .""  It is, therefore, quoted in full as a part of this report to the Convention:	""(1)	That they constitute a consensus of opinion of some Baptist body, large or small, for the general instruction and guidance of our own people and others concerning those articles of the Christian faith which are most surely held among us.  They are not intended to add anything to the simple conditions of salvation revealed in the New Testament, viz., repentance towards God and faith in Jesus Christ as Saviour and Lord.	""(2)	That we do not regard them as complete statements of our faith, having any quality of finality or infallibility.  As in the past so in the future, Baptists should hold themselves free to revise their statements of faith as may seem to them wise and expendient at any time.	""(3)	That any group of Baptists, large or small, have the inherent right to draw up for themselves and publish to the world a confession of their faith whenever they may think it advisable to do so.	""(4)	That the sole authority for faith and practice among Baptists is the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments.  Confessions are only guides in interpretation, having no authority over the conscience.	""(5)	That they are statements of religious convictions, drawn from the Scriptures, and are not to be used to hamper freedom of thought or investigation in other realms of life.""	The 1925 Statement recommended ""the New Hampshire Confession of Faith, revised at certain points, and with some additional articles growing out of certain needs . . . .""  Your present committee has adopted the same pattern.  It has sought to build upon the structure of the 1925 Statement, keeping in mind the ""certain needs"" of our generation.  At times it has reproduced sections of that Statement without change.  In other instances it has substituted words for clarity or added sentences for emphasis.  At certain points it has combined articles, with minor changes in wording, to endeavor to relate certain doctrines to each other.  In still others--e.g., ""God"" and ""Salvation""--it has sought to bring together certain truths contained throughout the 1925 Statement in order to relate them more clearly and concisely.  In no case has it sought to delete from or to add to the basic contents of the 1925 Statement.	Baptists are a people who profess a living faith.  This faith is rooted and grounded in Jesus Christ who is ""the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever.""  Therefore, the sole authority for faith and practice among Baptists is Jesus Christ whose will is revealed in the Holy Scriptures.	A living faith must experience a growing understanding of truth and must be continually interpreted and related to the needs of each new generation.  Throughout their history Baptist bodies, both large and small, have issued statements of faith which comprise a consensus of their beliefs.  Such statements have never been regarded as complete, infallible statements of faith, nor as official creeds carrying mandatory authority.  Thus this generation of Southern Baptists is in historic succession of intent and purpose as it endeavors to state for its time and theological climate those articles of the Christian faith which are most surely held among us.	Baptists emphasize the soul's competency before God, freedom in religion, and the priesthood of the believer.  However, this emphasis should not be interpreted to mean that there is an absence of certain definite doctrines that Baptists believe, cherish, and with which they have been and are now closely identified.	It is the purpose of this statement of faith and message to set forth certain teachings which we believe.	1963 STATEMENT	I.  THE SCRIPTURES	The Holy Bible was written by men divinely inspired and is the record of God's revelation of Himself to man.  It is a perfect treasure of divine instruction.  It has God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth, without any mixture of error, for its matter.  It reveals the principles by which God judges us; and therefore is, and will remain to the end of the world, the true center of Christian union, and the supreme standard by which all human conduct, creeds, and religious opinions should be tried.  The criterion by which the Bible is to be interpreted is Jesus Christ.	Ex. 24:4; Deut. 4:1-2; 17:19; Josh. 8:34; Psalms 19:7-10; 119:11,89,105,140; Isa. 34:16; 40:8; Jer. 15:16; 36; Matt. 5:17-18; 22:29; Luke 21:33; 24:44-46; John 5:39; 16:13-15; 17:17; Acts 2:16ff.; 17:11; Rom. 15:4; 16:25-26; 2 Tim. 3:15-17; Heb. 1:1-2; 4:12; 1 Peter 1:25; 2 Peter 1:19-21.	II. GOD	There is one and only one living and true God.  He is an intelligent, spiritual, and personal Being, the Creator, Redeemer, Preserver, and Ruler of the universe.  God is infinite in holiness and all other perfections.  To him we owe the highest love, reverence, and obedience.  The eternal God reveals Himself to us as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, with distinct personal attributes, but without division of nature, essence, or being.	1.  God the Father	God as Father reigns with providential care over His universe, His creatures, and the flow of the stream of human history according to the purposes of His grace.  He is all powerful, all loving, and all wise.  God is Father in truth to those who become children of God through faith in Jesus Christ.  He is fatherly in this attitude toward all men.	Gen. 1:1; 2:7; Ex. 3:14; 6:2-3; 15:11ff.; 20:1ff.; Levit. 22:2; Deut. 6:4; 32:6; 1 Chron. 29:10; Psalm 19:1-3; Isa. 43:3,15; 64:8; Jer. 10:10; 17:13; Matt. 6:9ff.; 7:11; 23:9; 28:19; Mark 1:9-11; John 4:24; 5:26; 14:6-13; 17:1-8; Acts 1:7; Rom. 8:14-15; 1 Cor. 8:6; Gal. 4:6; Ephes. 4:6; Col. 1:15; 1 Tim. 1:17; Heb. 11:6; 12:9; 1 Peter 1:17; 1 John 5:7.	2.  God the Son	Christ is the eternal Son of God.  In His incarnation as Jesus Christ He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary.  Jesus perfectly revealed and did the will of God, taking upon Himself the demands and necessities of human nature and identifying Himself completely with mankind yet without sin.  He honored the divine law by His personal obedience, and in His death on the cross He made provision for the redemption of men from sin.  He was raised from the dead with a glorified body and appeared to His disciples as the person who was with them before His crucifixion.  He ascended into heaven and is now exalted at the right hand of God where He is the One Mediator, partaking of the nature of God and of man, and in whose Person is effected the reconciliation between God and man.  He will return in power and glory to judge the world and to consummate His redemptive mission.  He now dwells in all believers as the living and ever present Lord.	Gen. 18:1ff.; Psalms 2:7ff.; 110:1ff.; Isa. 7:14; 53; Matt. 1:18-23; 3:17; 8:29; 11:27; 14:33; 16:16,27; 17:5; 27; 28:1-6,19; Mark 1:1; 3:11; Luke 1:35; 4:41; 22:70; 24:46; John 1:1-18,29; 10:30,38; 11:25-27; 12:44-50; 14:7-11; 16:15-16,28; 17:1-5, 21-22; 20:1-20,28; Acts 1:9; 2:22-24; 7:55-56; 9:4-5,20; Rom. 1:3-4; 3:23-26; 5:6-21; 8:1-3,34; 10:4; 1 Cor. 1:30; 2:2; 8:6; 15:1-8,24-28; 2 Cor. 5:19-21; 8:9; Gal. 4:4-5; Ephes. 1:20; 3:11; 4:7-10; Phil. 2:5-11; Col. 1:13-22; 2:9; 1 Thess. 4:14-18; 1 Tim. 2:5-6; 3:16; Titus 2:13-14; Heb. 1:1-3; 4:14-15; 7:14-28; 9:12-15,24-28; 12:2; 13:8; 1 Peter 2:21-25; 3:22; 1 John 1:7-9; 3:2; 4:14-15; 5:9; 2 John 7-9; Rev. 1:13-16; 5:9-14; 12:10-11; 13:8; 19:16.	3.  God the Holy Spirit	The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God.  He inspired holy men of old to write the Scriptures.  Through illumination He enables men to understand truth.  He exalts Christ.  He convicts of sin, of righteousness and of judgment.  He calls men to the Saviour, and effects regeneration.  He cultivates Christian character, comforts believers, and bestows the spiritual gifts by which they serve God through His church.  He seals the believer unto the day of final redemption.  His presence in the Christian is the assurance of God to bring the believer into the fulness of the stature of Christ.  He enlightens and empowers the believer and the church in worship, evangelism, and service.	Gen. 1:2; Judg. 14:6; Job 26:13; Psalms 51:11; 139:7ff.; Isa. 61:1-3; Joel 2:28-32; Matt. 1:18; 3:16; 4:1; 12:28-32; 28:19; Mark 1:10,12; Luke 1:35; 4:1,18-19; 11:13; 12:12; 24:49; John 4:24; 14:16-17,26; 15:26; 16:7-14; Acts 1:8; 2:1-4,38; 4:31; 5:3; 6:3; 7:55; 8:17,39; 10:44; 13:2; 15:28; 16:6; 19:1-6; Rom. 8:9-11,14-16,26-27; 1 Cor. 2:10-14; 3:16; 12:3-11; Gal. 4:6; Ephes. 1:13-14; 4:30; 5:18; 1 Thess. 5:19; 1 Tim. 3:16; 4:1; 2 Tim. 1:14; 3:16; Heb. 9:8,14; 2 Peter 1:21; 1 John 4:13; 5:6-7; Rev. 1:10; 22:17.	III.  MAN	Man was created by the special act of God, in His own image, and is the crowning work of His creation.  In the beginning man was innocent of sin and was endowed by his Creator with freedom of choice.  By his free choice man sinned against God and brought sin into the human race.  Through the temptation of Satan man transgressed the command of God, and fell from his original innocence; whereby his posterity inherit a nature and an environment inclined toward sin, and as soon as they are capable of moral action become transgressors and are under condemnation.  Only the grace of God can bring man into His holy fellowship and enable man to fulfil the creative purpose of God.  The sacredness of human personality is evident in that God created man in His own image, and in that Christ died for man; therefore every man possesses dignity and is worthy of respect and Christian life.	Gen. 1:26-30; 2:5,7,18-22; 3; 9:6; Psalms 1; 8:3-6; 32:1-5; 51:5; Isa. 6:5; Jer. 17:5; Matt. 16:26; Acts 17: 26-31; Rom. 1:19-32; 3:10-18,23; 5:6,12,19; 6:6; 7:14-25; 8:14-18,29; 1 Cor. 1:21-31; 15:19,21-22; Eph. 2:1-22; Col. 1:21-22; 3:9-11.	IV. SALVATION	Salvation involves the redemption of the whole man, and is offered freely to all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour, who by His own blood obtained eternal redemption for the believer.  In its broadest sense salvation includes regeneration, sanctification, and glorification.	1.  Regeneration, or the new birth, is a work of God's grace whereby believers become new creatures in Christ Jesus.  It is a change of heart wrought by the Holy Spirit through conviction of sin, to which the sinner responds in repentance toward God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.	Repentance and faith are inseparable experiences of grace.  Repentance is a genuine turning from sin toward God.  Faith is the acceptance of Jesus Christ and commitment of the entire personality to Him as Lord and Saviour.  Justification is God's gracious and full acquittal upon principles of His righteousness of all sinners who repent and believe in Christ.  Justification brings the believer into a relationship of peace and favor with God.	2.  Sanctification is the experience, beginning in regeneration, by which the believer is set apart to God's purposes, and is enabled to progress toward moral and spiritual perfection through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in him.  Growth in grace should continue throughout the regenerate person's life.	3.  Glorification is the culmination of salvation and is the final blessed and abiding state of the redeemed.	Gen. 3:15; Ex. 3:14-17; 6:2-8; Matt. 1:21; 4:17; 16:21-26; 27:22-28:6; Luke 1:68-69; 2:28-32; John 1:11-14,29; 3:3-21,36; 5:24; 10:9,28-29; 15:1-16; 17:17; Acts 2:21; 4:12; 15:11; 16:30-31; 17:30-31; 20:32; Rom. 1:16-18; 2:4; 3:23-25; 4:3ff.; 5:8-10; 6:1-23; 8:1-18,29-39; 10:9-10,13; 13:11-14; 1 Cor. 1:18,30; 6:19-20; 15:10; 2 Cor. 5:17-20; Gal. 2:20; 3:13; 5:22-25; 6:15; Ephes. 1:7; 2:8-22; 4:11-16; Phil. 2:12-13; Col. 1:9-22; 3:1ff.; 1 Thess. 5:23-24; 2 Tim. 1:12; Titus 2:11-14; Heb. 2:1-3; 5:8-9; 9:24-28; 11:1-12:8,14; James 2:14-26; 1 Peter 1:2-23; 1 John 1:6-2:11; Rev. 3:20; 21:1-22:5.	V.  GOD'S PURPOSE OF GRACE	Election is the gracious purpose of God, according to which He regenerates, sanctifies, and glorifies sinners.  It is consistent with the free agency of man and comprehends all the means in connection with the end.  It is a glorious display of God's sovereign goodness, and is infinitely wise, holy, and unchangeable.  It excludes boasting and promotes humility.	All true believers endure to the end.  Those whom God has accepted in Christ, and sanctified by His Spirit, will never fall away from the state of grace, but shall persevere to the end.  Believers may fall into sin through neglect and temptation, whereby they grieve the Spirit, impair their graces and comforts, bring reproach on the cause of Christ, and temporal judgments on themselves, yet they shall be kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.	Gen. 12:1-3; Ex. 19:5-8; 1 Sam. 8:4-7,19-22; Isa. 5:1-7; Jer. 31:31ff.; Matt. 16:18-19; 21:28-45; 24:22,31; 25:34; Luke 1:68-79; 2:29-32; 19:41-44; 24:44-48; John 1:12-14; 3:16; 5:24; 6:44-45,65; 10:27-29; 15:16; 17:6,12,17-18; Acts 20:32; Rom. 5:9-10; 8:28-39; 10:12-15; 11:5-7,26-36; 1 Cor. 1:1-2; 15:24-28; Ephes. 1:4-23; 2:1-10; 3:1-11; Col. 1:12-14; 2 Thess. 2:13-14; 2 Tim. 1:12; 2:10,19; Heb. 11:39-12:2; 1 Peter 1:2-5,13; 2:4-10; 1 John 1:7-9; 2:19, 3:2.	VI.  THE CHURCH	A New Testament church of the Lord Jesus Christ is a local body of baptized believers who are associated by covenant in the faith and fellowship of the gospel, observing the two ordinances of Christ, committed to His teachings, exercising the gifts, rights, and privileges invested in them by His Word, and seeking to extend the gospel to the ends of the earth.	This church is an autonomous body, operating through democratic processes under the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  In such a congregation, members are equally responsible.  Its Scriptural officers are pastors and deacons.	The New Testament speaks also of the church as the body of Christ which includes all of the redeemed of all the ages.	Matt. 16:15-19; 18:15-20; Acts 2:41-42,47; 5:11-14; 6:3-6; 13:1-3; 14:23,27; 15:1-30; 16:5; 20:28; Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:2; 3:16; 5:4-5; 7:17; 9:13-14; 12; Ephes. 1:22-23; 2:19-22; 3:8-11,21; 5:22-32; Phil. 1:1; Col. 1:18; 1 Tim. 3:1-15; 4:14; 1 Peter 5:1-4; Rev. 2-3; 21:2-3.	VII.  BAPTISM AND THE LORD'S SUPPER	Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  It is an act of obedience symbolizing the believer's faith in a crucified, buried, and risen Saviour, the believer's death to sin, the burial of the old life, and the resurrection to walk in newness of life in Christ Jesus.  It is a testimony to his faith in the final resurrection of the dead.  Being a church ordinance, it is prerequisite to the privileges of church membership and to the Lord's Supper.	The Lord's Supper is a symbolic act of obedience whereby members of the church, through partaking of the bread and the fruit of the vine, memorialize the death of the Redeemer and anticipate His second coming.	Matt. 3:13-17; 26:26-30; 28:19-20; Mark 1:9-11; 14:22-26; Luke 3:21-22; 22:19-20; John 3:23; Acts 2:41-42; 8:35-39; 16:30-33; Acts 20; 7; Rom. 6:3-5; 1 Cor. 10:16,21; 11:23-29; Col. 2:12.	VIII. THE LORD'S DAY	The first day of the week is the Lord's Day.  It is a Christian institution for regular observance.  It commemorates the resurrection of Christ from the dead and should be employed in exercises of worship and spiritual devotion, both public and private, and by refraining from worldly amusements, and resting from secular employments, work of necessity and mercy only being excepted.	Ex. 20:8-11; Matt. 12:1-12; 28:1ff.; Mark 2:27-28; 16:1-7; Luke 24:1-3,33-36; John 4:21-24; 20:1,19-28; Acts 20:7; 1 Cor. 16:1-2; Col. 2:16; 3:16; Rev. 1:10.	IX.  THE KINGDOM	The kingdom of God includes both His general sovereignty over the universe and His particular kingship over men who willfully acknowledge Him as King.  Particularly the kingdom is the realm of salvation into which men enter by trustful, childlike commitment to Jesus Christ.  Christians ought to pray and to labor that the kingdom may come and God's will be done on earth.  The full consummation of the kingdom awaits the return of Jesus Christ and the end of this age.	Gen. 1:1; Isa. 9:6-7; Jer. 23:5-6; Matt. 3:2; 4:8-10,23; 12:25-28; 13:1-52; 25:31-46; 26:29; Mark 1:14-15; 9:1; Luke 4:43; 8:1; 9:2; 12:31-32; 17:20-21; 23:42; John 3:3; 18:36; Acts 1:6-7; 17:22-31; Rom. 5:17; 8:19; 1 Cor. 15:24-28; Col. 1:13; Heb. 11:10,16; 12:28; 1 Peter 2:4-10; 4:13; Rev. 1:6,9; 5:10; 11:15; 21-22.	X.  LAST THINGS	God, in His own time and in His own way, will bring the world to its appropriate end.  According to His promise, Jesus Christ will return personally and visibly in glory to the earth; the dead will be raised; and Christ will judge all men in righteousness.  The unrighteous will be consigned to hell, the place of everlasting punishment.  The righteous in their resurrected and glorified bodies will receive their reward and will dwell forever in heaven with the Lord.	Isa. 2:4; 11:9; Matt. 16:27; 18:8-9; 19:28; 24:27,30,36,44; 25:31-46; 26:64; Mark 8:38; 9:43-48; Luke 12:40,48; 16:19-26; 17:22-37; 21:27-28; John 14:1-3; Acts 1:11; 17:31; Rom. 14:10; 1 Cor. 4:5; 15:24-28,35-58; 2 Cor. 5:10; Phil. 3:20-21; Col. 1:5; 3:4; 1 Thess. 4:14-18; 5:1ff.; 2 Thess. 1:7ff.; 2; 1 Tim. 6:14; 2 Tim. 4:1,8; Titus 2:13; Heb. 9:27-28; James 5:8; 2 Peter 3:7ff.; 1 John 2:28; 3:2; Jude 14; Rev. 1:18; 3:11; 20:1-22:13.	XI.  EVANGELISM AND MISSIONS	It is the duty and privilege of every follower of Christ and of every church of the Lord Jesus Christ to endeavor to make disciples of all nations.  The new birth of man's spirit by God's Holy Spirit means the birth of love for others.  Missionary effort on the part of all rests thus upon a spiritual necessity of the regenerate life, and is expressly and repeatedly commanded in the teachings of Christ.  It is the duty of every child of God to seek constantly to win the lost to Christ by personal effort and by all other methods in harmony with the gospel of Christ.	Gen. 12:1-3; Ex. 19:5-6; Isa. 6:1-8; Matt. 9:37-38; 10:5-15; 13:18-30,37-43; 16:19; 22:9-10; 24:14; 28:18-20; Luke 10:1-18; 24:46-53; John 14:11-12; 15:7-8,16; 17:15; 20:21; Acts 1:8; 2; 8:26-40; 10:42-48; 13:2-3; Rom. 10:13-15; Ephes. 3:1-11; 1 Thess. 1:8; 2 Tim. 4:5; Heb. 2:1-3; 11:39-12:2; 1 Peter 2:4-10; Rev. 22:17.	XII.  EDUCATION	The cause of education in the kingdom of Christ is coordinate with the causes of missions and general benevolence and should receive along with these the liberal support of the churches.  An adequate system of Christian schools is necessary to a complete spiritual program for Christ's people.	In Christian education there should be a proper balance between academic freedom and academic responsibility.  Freedom in any orderly relationship of human life is always limited and never absolute.  The freedom of a teacher in a Christian school, college, or seminary is limited by the pre-eminence of Jesus Christ, by the authoritative nature of the Scriptures, and by the distinct purpose for which the school exists.	Deut. 4:1,5,9,14; 6:1-10; 31:12-13; Neh. 8:1-8; Job. 28:28; Psalms 19:7ff.; 119:11; Prov. 3:13ff.; 4:1-10; 8:1-7,11; 15:14; Eccl. 7:19; Matt. 5:2; 7:24ff.; 28:19-20; Luke 2:40; 1 Cor. 1:18-31; Eph. 4:11-16; Phil. 4:8; Col. 2:3,8-9; 1 Tim. 1:3-7; 2 Tim. 2:15; 3:14-17; Heb. 5:12-6:3; James 1:5; 3:17.	XIII. STEWARDSHIP	God is the source of all blessings, temporal and spiritual; all that we have and are we owe to Him.  Christians have a spiritual debtorship to the whole world, a holy trusteeship in the gospel, and a binding stewardship in their possessions.  They are therefore under obligation to serve Him with their time, talents, and material possessions; and should recognize all these as entrusted to them to use for the glory of God and for helping others.  According to the Scriptures, Christians should contribute of their means cheerfully, regularly, systematically, proportionately, and liberally for the advancement of the Redeemer's cause on earth.	Gen. 14:20; Lev. 27:30-32; Deut. 8:18; Mal. 3:8-12; Matt. 6:1-4,19-21; 19:21; 23:23; 25:14-29; Luke 12:16-21,42; 16:1-13; Acts 2:44-47; 5:1-11; 17-24-25; 20:35; Rom. 6:6-22; 12:1-2; 1 Cor. 4:1-2; 6:19-20; 12; 16:1-4; 2 Cor. 8-9; 12:15; Phil. 4:10-19; 1 Peter 1:18-19.	XIV.  COOPERATION	Christ's people should, as occasion requires, organize such associations and conventions as may best secure cooperation for the great objects of the kingdom of God.  Such organizations have no authority over one another or over the churches.  They are voluntary and advisory bodies designed to elicit, combine, and direct the energies of our people in the most effective manner.  Members of New Testament churches should cooperate with one another in carrying forward the missionary, educational, and benevolent ministries for the extension of Christ's kingdom.  Christian unity in the New Testament sense is spiritual harmony and voluntary cooperation for common ends by various groups of Christ's people.  Cooperation is desirable between the various Christian denominations, when the end to be attained is itself justified, and when such cooperation involves no violation of conscience or compromise of loyalty to Christ and his Word as revealed in the New Testament.	Ex. 17:12; 18:17ff.; Judg. 7:21; Ezra 1:3-4; 2:68-69; 5:14-15; Neh. 4; 8:1-5; Matt. 10:5-15; 20:1-16; 22:1-10; 28:19-20; Mark 2:3; Luke 10:1ff.; Acts 1:13-14; 2:1ff.; 4:31-37; 13:2-3; 15:1-35; 1 Cor. 1:10-17; 3:5-15; 12; 2 Cor. 8-9; Gal. 1:6-10; Eph. 4:1-16; Phil. 1:15-18.	XV.  THE CHRISTIAN AND THE SOCIAL ORDER	Every Christian is under obligation to seek to make the will of Christ supreme in his own life and in human society.  Means and methods used for the improvement of society and the establishment of righteousness among men can be truly and permanently helpful only when they are rooted in the regeneration of the individual by the saving grace of God in Christ Jesus.  The Christian should oppose in the spirit of Christ every form of greed, selfishness, and vice.  He should work to provide for the orphaned, the needy, the aged, the helpless, and the sick.  Every Christian should seek to bring industry, government, and society as a whole under the sway of the principles of righteousness, truth, and brotherly love.  In order to promote these ends Christians should be ready to work with all men of good will in any good cause, always being careful to act in the spirit of love without compromising their loyalty to Christ and his truth.	Ex. 20:3-17; Lev. 6:2-5; Deut. 10:12; 27:17; Psalm 101:5; Micah 6:8; Zech. 8:16; Matt. 5:13-16,43-48; 22:36-40; 25:35; Mark 1:29-34; 2:3ff.; 10:21; Luke 4:18-21; 10:27-37; 20:25; John 15:12; 17:15; Rom. 12-14; 1 Cor. 5:9-10; 6:1-7; 7:20-24; 10:23-11:1; Gal. 3:26-28; Eph. 6:5-9; Col. 3:12-17; 1 Thess. 3:12; Philemon; James 1:27; 2:8.	XVI.  PEACE AND WAR	It is the duty of Christians to seek peace with all men on principles of righteousness.  In accordance with the spirit and teachings of Christ they should do all in their power to put an end to war.	The true remedy for the war spirit is the gospel of our Lord.  The supreme need of the world is the acceptance of His teachings in all the affairs of men and nations, and the practical application of His law of love.	Isa. 2:4; Matt. 5:9,38-48; 6:33; 26:52; Luke 22:36,38; Rom. 12:18-19; 13:1-7; 14:19; Heb. 12:14; James 4:1-2.	XVII.  RELIGIOUS LIBERTY	God alone is Lord of the conscience, and He has left it free from the doctrines and commandments of men which are contrary to His Word or not contained in it.  Church and state should be separate.  The state owes to every church protection and full freedom in the pursuit of its spiritual ends.  In providing for such freedom no ecclesiastical group or denomination should be favored by the state more than others.  Civil government being ordained of God, it is the duty of Christians to render loyal obedience thereto in all things not contrary to the revealed will of God.  The church should not resort to the civil power to carry on its work.  The gospel of Christ contemplates spiritual means alone for the pursuit of its ends.  The state has no right to impose penalties for religious opinions of any kind.  The state has no right to impose taxes for the support of any form of religion.  A free church in a free state is the Christian ideal, and this implies the right of free and unhindered access to God on the part of all men and the right to form and propagate opinions in the sphere of religion without interference by the civil power.	Gen. 1:27; 2:7; Matt. 6:6-7; 16:26; 22:21; John 8:36; Acts 4:19-20; Rom. 6:1-2; 13:1-7; Gal. 5:1,13; Phil. 3:20; 1 Tim. 2:1-2; James 4:12; 1 Peter 2:12-17; 3:11-17; 4:12-19.	NOTE.--The 1925 Statement of Faith, printed below, is given here only for ease of reference and was not a part of the Convention's action in its 1962 session.	1925 STATEMENT	I.  THE SCRIPTURES	We believe that the Holy Bible was written by men divinely inspired, and is a perfect treasure of heavenly instruction; that it has God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth, without any mixture of error, for its matter; that it reveals the principles by which God will judge us; and therefore is, and will remain to the end of the world, the true center of Christian union, and the supreme standard by which all human conduct, creeds and religious opinions should be tried.	Luke 16:29-31; 2 Tim. 3:15-17; Eph. 2:20; Heb. 1:1; 2 Peter 1:19-21; John 16:13-15; Matt. 22:29-31; Psalm 19:7-10; Psalm 119:1-8.	II.  GOD	There is one and only one living and true God, an intelligent, spiritual, and personal Being, the Creator, Preserver, and Ruler of the universe, infinite in holiness and all other perfections, to whom we owe the highest love, reverence, and obedience.  He is revealed to us as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, each with distinct personal attributes, but without division of nature, essence, or being.	Gen. 1:1; 1 Cor. 8:4-6; Deut. 6:4; Jer. 10:10; Isa. 48:12; Deut. 5:7; Ex. 3:14; Heb. 11:6; John 5:26; 1 Tim. 1:17; John 1:14-18; John 15:26; Gal. 4:6; Matt. 28:19.	III.  THE FALL OF MAN	Man was created by the special act of God, as recorded in Genesis.  ""So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them"" (Gen. 1:27).  ""And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul""  (Gen. 2:7).	He was created in a state of holiness under the law of his Maker, but, through the temptation of Satan, he transgressed the command of God and fell from his original holiness and righteousness; whereby his posterity inherit a nature corrupt and in bondage to sin, are under condemnation, and as soon as they are capable of moral action, become actual transgressors.	Gen. 1:27; Gen. 2:7; John 1:23; Gen. 3:4-7; Gen. 3:22-24; Rom. 5:12,14,19,21; Rom. 7:23-25; Rom. 11:18,22,32-33; Col. 1:21.	IV.  THE WAY OF SALVATION	The salvation of sinners is wholly of grace, through the mediatorial office of the Son of God, who by the Holy Spirit was born of the Virgin Mary and took upon him our nature, yet without sin; honored the divine law by his personal obedience and made atonement for our sins by his death.  Being risen from the dead, he is now enthroned in Heaven, and, writing in his person the tenderest sympathies with divine perfections, he is in every way qualified to be a compassionate and all-sufficient Saviour.	Col. 1:21-22; Eph. 1:7-10; Gal. 2:19-20; Gal. 3:13; Rom. 1:4; Eph. 1:20-23; Matt. 1:21-25; Luke 1:35; 2:11; Rom. 3:25.	V.  JUSTIFICATION	Justification is God's gracious and full acquittal upon principles of righteousness of all sinners who believe in Christ.  This blessing is bestowed, not in consideration of any works of righteousness which we have done, but through the redemption that is in and through Jesus Christ.  It brings us into a state of most blessed peace and favor with God, and secures every other needed blessing.	Rom. 3:24; 4:2; 5:1-2; 8:30; Eph. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:30-31; 2 Cor. 5:21.	VI.  THE FREENESS OF SALVATIOIN	The blessings of salvation are made free to all by the gospel.  It is the duty of all to accept them by penitent and obedient faith.  Nothing prevents the salvation of the greatest sinner except his own voluntary refusal to accept Jesus Christ as teacher, Saviour, and Lord.	Eph. 1:5; 2:4-10; 1 Cor. 1:30-31; Rom. 5:1-9; Rev. 22:17; John 3:16; Mark 16:16.	VII.  REGENERATION	Regeneration or the new birth is a change of heart wrought by the Holy Spirit, whereby we become partakers of the divine nature and a holy disposition is given, leading to the love and practice of righteousness.  It is a work of God's free grace conditioned upon faith in Christ and made manifest by the fruit which we bring forth to the glory of God.	John 3:1-8; 1:16-18; Rom. 8:2; Eph. 2:1,5-6,8-10; Eph. 4:30,32; Col. 3:1-11; Titus 3:5.	VIII.  REPENTANCE AND FAITH	We believe that repentance and faith are sacred duties, and also inseparable graces, wrought in our souls by the regenerating Spirit of God; whereby being deeply convinced of our guilt, danger, and helplessness, and of the way of salvation by Christ, we turn to God with unfeigned contrition, confession, and supplication for mercy; at the same time heartily receiving the Lord Jesus Christ as our Prophet, Priest, and King, and relying on him alone as the only and all-sufficient Saviour.	Luke 22:31-34; Mark 1:15; 1 Tim. 1:13; Rom. 3:25,27,31; Rom. 4:3,9,12,16-17; John 16:8-11.	X.  SANCTIFICATION	Sanctification is the process by which the regenerate gradually attain to moral and spiritual perfection through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in their hearts.  It continues throughout the earthly life, and is accomplished by the use of all the ordinary means of grace, and particularly by the Word of God.	Acts 20:32; John 17:17; Rom. 6:5-6; Eph. 3:16; Rom. 4:14; Gal. 5:24; Heb. 12:14; Rom. 7:18-25; 2 Cor. 3:18; Gal. 5:16,25-26.	IX.  GOD'S PURPOSE OF GRACE	Election is the gracious purpose of God, according to which he regenerates, sanctifies and saves sinners.  It is perfectly consistent with the free agency of man, and comprehends all the means in connection with the end.  It is a most glorious display of God's sovereign goodness, and is infinitely wise, holy, and unchangeable.  It excludes boasting and promotes humility.  It encourages the use of means in the highest degree.	Rom. 8:30; 11:7; Eph. 1:10; Acts 26:18; Eph. 1:17-19; 2 Tim. 1:9; Psalm 110:3; 1 Cor. 2:14; Eph. 2:5; John 6:44-45,65; Rom. 10:12-15.PERSEVERANCE	All real believers endure to the end.  Their continuance in well-doing is the mark which distinguishes them from mere professors.  A special Providence cares for them, and they are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.	John 10:28-29; 2 Tim. 2:19; 1 John 2:19; 1 Cor. 11:32; Rom. 8:30; 9:11,16; Rom. 5:9-10; Matt. 26:70-75.	XII.  A GOSPEL CHURCH	A church of Christ is a congregation of baptized believers, associated by covenant in the faith and fellowship of the gospel; observing the ordinances of Christ, governed by his laws, and exercising the gifts, rights, and privileges invested in them by his word, and seeking to extend the gospel to the ends of the earth.  Its Scriptural officers are bishops, or elders, and deacons.	Matt. 16:18; Matt. 18:15-18; Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:2; Acts 2:41-42; 5:13-14; 2 Cor. 9:13; Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 4:14; Acts. 14:23; Acts 6:3,5-6; Heb. 13:17; 1 Cor. 9:6,14.	XIII.  BAPTISM AND THE LORD'S SUPPER	Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  The act is a symbol of our faith in a crucified, buried and risen Saviour.  It is prerequisite to the privileges of a church relation and to the Lord's Supper, in which the members of the church, by the use of bread and wine, commemorate the dying love of Christ.	Matt. 28:19-20; 1 Cor. 4:1; Rom. 6:3-5; Col. 2:12; Mark 1:4; Matt. 3:16; John 3:23; 1 Cor. 11:23-26; 1 Cor. 10:16-17,21; Matt. 26:26-27; Acts 8:38-39; Mark 1:9-11.	XIV.  THE LORD'S DAY	The first day of the week is the Lord's day.  It is a Christian institution for regular observance.  It commemorates the resurrection of Christ from the dead and should be employed in exercises of worship and spiritual devotion, both public and private, and by refraining from worldly amusements, and resting from secular employments, works of necessity and mercy only excepted.	Ex. 20:3-6; Matt. 4:10; Matt. 28:19; 1 Tim. 4:13; Col. 3:16; John 4:21; Ex. 20:8; 1 Cor. 16:1-2; Acts 20:7; Rev.1:1; Matt. 12:1-13.	XXV.  THE KINGDOM	The Kingdom of God is the reign of God in the heart and life of the individual in every human relationship, and in every form and institution of organized human society.  The chief means for promoting the Kingdom of God on earth are preaching the gospel of Christ, and teaching the principles of righteousness contained therein.  The Kingdom of God will be complete when every thought and will of man shall be brought into captivity to the will of Christ.  And it is the duty of all Christ's people to pray and labor continually that his Kingdom may come and his will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.	Dan. 2:37-44; 7:18; Matt. 4:23; 8:12; 12:25; 13:38,43; 25:34; 26:29; Mark 11:10; Luke 12:32; 22:29; Acts 1:6; 1 Cor. 15:24; Col. 1:13; Heb. 12:28; Rev. 1:9; Luke 4:43; 8:1; 9:2; 17:20-21; John 3:3; John 18:36; Matt. 6:10; Luke 23:42.	XV.  THE RIGHTEOUS AND THE WICKED	There is a radical and essential difference between the righteous and wicked.  Those only who are justified through the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and sanctified by the Holy Spirit are truly righteous in his sight.  Those who continue in impenitence and unbelief are in his sight wicked and are under condemnation.  This distinction between the righteous and the wicked holds in and after death, and will be made manifest at the judgment when final and everlasting awards are made to all men.	Gen. 3:19; Acts 13:36; Luke 23:43; 2 Cor. 5:1,6,8; Phil. 1:23; 1 Cor. 15:51-52; 1 Thess. 4:17; Phil. 3:21; 1 Cor. 6:3; Matt. 25:32-46; Rom. 9:22-23; Mark 9:48; 1 Thess. 1:7-10; Rev. 22:20.	XVI.  THE RESURRECTION	The Scriptures clearly teach that Jesus rose from the dead.  His grave was emptied of its contents.  He appeared to the disciples after his resurrection in many convincing manifestations.  He now exists in his glorified body at God's right hand.  There will be a resurrection of the righteous and the wicked.  The bodies of the righteous will conform to the glorious spiritual body of Jesus.	1 Cor. 15:1-58; 2 Cor. 5:1-8; 1 Thess. 4:17; John 5:28-29; Phil. 3:21; Acts 24:15; John 20:9; Matt. 28:6.	XVII.  THE RETURN OF THE LORD	The New Testament teaches in many places the visible and personal return of Jesus to this earth.  ""This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.""  The time of his coming is not revealed.  ""Of that day and hour knoweth no one, no, not the angels in heaven, but my Father only"" (Matt. 24:36).  It is the duty of all believers to live in readiness for his coming and by diligence in good works to make manifest to all men the reality and power of their hope in Christ.	Matt. 24:36; Matt. 24:42-47; Mark 13:32-37; Luke 21:27-28; Acts 1:9-11.	XXIII.  EVANGELISM AND MISSIONS	It is the duty of every Christian man and woman, and the duty of every church of Christ to seek to extend the gospel to the ends of the earth.  The new birth of man's spirit by God's Holy Spirit means the birth of love for others.  Missionary effort on the part of all rests thus upon a spiritual necessity of the regenerate life.  It is also expressly and repeatedly commanded in the teachings of Christ.  It is the duty of every child of God to seek constantly to win the lost to Christ by personal effort and by all other methods sanctioned by the gospel of Christ.	Matt. 10:5; 13:18-23; 22:9-10; 28:19-20; Mark 16:15-16; 16:19-20; Luke 24:46-53; Acts 1:5-8; 2:1-2,21,39; 8:26-40; 10:42-48; 13:2,30-33; 1 Thess. 1-8.	XX.  EDUCATION	Christianity is the religion of enlightenment and intelligence.  In Jesus Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.  All sound learning is therefore a part of our Christian heritage.  The new birth opens all human faculties and creates a thirst for knowledge.  An adequate system of schools is necessary to a complete spiritual program for Christ's people.  The cause of education in the Kingdom of Christ is coordinate with the causes of missions and general benevolence, and should receive along with these the liberal support of the churches.	Deut. 4:1,5,9,13-14; Deut. 6:1,7-10; Psalm 19:7-8; Prov. 8:1-7; Prov. 4:1-10; Matt. 28:20; Col. 2:3; Neh. 8:1-4.	XXIV.  STEWARDSHIP	God is the source of all blessings, temporal and spiritual; all that we have and are we owe to him.  We have a spiritual debtorship to the whole world, a holy trusteeship in the gospel, and a binding stewardship in our possessions.  We are therefore under obligation to serve him with our time, talents and material possessions; and should recognize all these as entrusted to us to use for the glory of God and helping others.  Christians should cheerfully, regularly, systematically, proportionately, and liberally, contribute of their means to advancing the Redeemer's cause on earth.	Luke 12:42; 16:1-8; Titus 1:7; 1 Peter 4:10; 2 Cor. 8:1-7; 2 Cor. 8:11-19; 2 Cor. 12:1-15; Matt. 25:14-30; Rom. 1:8-15; 1 Cor. 6:20; Acts 2:44-47.	XXII.  COOPERATION	Christ's people should, as occasion requires, organize such associations and conventions as may best secure cooperation for the great objects of the Kingdom of God.  Such organizations have no authority over each other or over the churches.  They are voluntary and advisory bodies designed to elicit, combine, and direct the energies of our people in the most effective manner.  Individual members of New Testament churches should cooperate with each other, and the churches themselves should cooperate with each other in carrying forward the missionary, educational, and benevolent program for the extension of Christ's Kingdom.  Christian unity in the New Testament sense is spiritual harmony and voluntary cooperation for common ends by various groups of Christ's people.  It is permissable and desirable as between the various Christian denominations, when the end to be attained is itself justified, and when such cooperation involves no violation of conscience or compromise of loyalty to Christ and his Word as revealed in the New Testament.	Ezra 1:3-4; 2:68-69; 5:14-15; Neh. 4:4-6; 8:1-4; Mal. 3:10; Matt. 10:5-15; 20:1-16; 22:1-10; Acts 1:13-14; 1:21-26; 2:1,41-47; 1 Cor. 1:10-17; 12:11-12; 13; 14:33-34,40; 16:2; 2 Cor. 9:1-15; Eph. 4:1-16; 3 John 1:5-8.	XXI.  SOCIAL SERVICE	Every Christian is under obligation to seek to make the will of Christ regnant in his own life and in human society to oppose in the spirit of Christ every form of greed, selfishness, and vice; to provide for the orphaned, the aged, the helpless, and the sick; to seek to bring industry, government, and society as a whole under the sway of the principles of righteousness, truth and brotherly love; to promote these ends Christians should be ready to work with all men of good will in any good cause, always being careful to act in the spirit of love without compromising their loyalty to Christ and his truth.  All means and methods used in social service for the amelioration of society and the establishment of righteousness among men must finally depend on the regeneration of the individual by the saving grace of God in Christ Jesus.	Luke 10:25-37; Ex. 22:10,14; Lev. 6:2; Deut. 20:10; Deut. 4:42; Deut. 15:2; 27:17; Psalm 101:5; Ezek. 18:6; Heb. 2:15; Zech. 8:16; Ex. 20:16; James 2:8; Rom. 12-14; Col. 3-12-17.	XIX.  PEACE AND WAR	It is the duty of Christians to seek peace with all men on principles of righteousness.  In accordance with the spirit and teachings of Christ they should do all in their power to put an end to war.	The true remedy for the war spirit is the pure gospel of our Lord.  The supreme need of the world is the acceptance of his teachings in all the affairs of men and nations, and the practical application of his law of love.	We urge Christian people throughout the world to pray for the reign of the Prince of Peace, and to oppose everything likely to provoke war.	Matt. 5:9,13-14,43-46; Heb. 12:14; James 4:1; Matt. 6:33; Rom. 14:17,19.	XVII.  RELIGIOUS LIBERTY	God alone is Lord of the conscience, and he has left it free from the doctrines and commandments of men which are contrary to his Word or not contained in it.  Church and state should be separate.  The state owes to the church protection and full freedom in the pursuit of its spiritual ends.  In providing for such freedom no ecclesiastical group or denomination should be favored by the state more than others.  Civil government being ordained of God, it is the duty of Christians to render loyal obedience thereto in all things not contrary to the revealed will of God.  The church should not resort to the civil power to carry on its work.  The gospel of Christ contemplates spiritual means alone for the pursuit of its ends.  The state has no right to impose penalties for religious opinions of any kind.  The state has no right to impose taxes for the support of any form of religion.  A free church in a free state is the Christian ideal, and this implies the right of free and unhindered access to God on the part of all men, and the right to form and propagate opinions in the sphere of religion without interference by the civil power.	Rom. 13:1-7; 1 Peter 2:17; 1 Tim. 2:1-2; Gal. 3:9-14; John 7:38-39; James 4:12; Gal. 5:13; 2 Peter 2:18-21; 1 Cor. 3:5; Rom. 6:1-2; Matt. 22:21; Mark 12:17.

"418","We reaffirm our historic stand for human freedom, self government, and religious liberty for all people.  We pledge to fellow Baptists and to all others who do not enjoy true freedom that we will keep them in our thoughts and prayers, and will work continually with them for the ultimate realization of their right to full freedom of religion and the other inalienable liberties with which all mankind is endowed by the Creator.	RESOLUTION ON CHRISTIAN RESPONSIBILITY	WHEREAS, Christian people have historically felt a concern and a sense of responsibility for the social structure of their contemporary societies, and	WHEREAS, The Southern Baptist Convention has from time to time felt the advisability of expressing itself on questions of great national moment, and	WHEREAS, The issues underlying the problems involved in our social adjustments today are essentially spiritual in nature, and	WHEREAS, The problems are not sectional but national in scope, and	WHEREAS, Southern Baptists historically have preached and taught the principles of individual responsibility on all religious matters,	Be it therefore RESOLVED:	1.  That this Southern Baptist Convention state again its firm belief that such problems are not solved except within the framework of Christian love, compassion, mutual confidence, and prayer, and	2.  That we offer our hope and prayer that all concerned shall maintain open communications so that an atmosphere of knowledge and truth may be developed out of which a spiritual and Christian settlement may be determined, and	3.  That this Southern Baptist Convention urge all of its messengers herein constituted to confront any and all problems in the light of the spiritual issues involved and to make it a matter of prayer and personal commitment, and	4.  That we reaffirm our belief in the responsibility of every individual and local community to seek out solutions consistent with the teachings and examples of Jesus Christ, conscious that the only permanent and satisfactory solutions must be based upon Christian concepts.",1963
"419","WHEREAS, Several proposals have been made in the Congress of the United States, that Federal Public Funds be granted to church-related colleges and universities for the construction of academic facilities, and	WHEREAS, Reports are now current regarding active sponsorship for proposals granting tax funds to church colleges for the construction of basic educational facilities, such as libraries, laboratories, and classrooms, and	WHEREAS, Baptists are committed to the principle of supporting taxation for public purposes, only, leaving church institutions to the voluntary support of persons desiring to participate in the support of and maintenance of those institutions; and	WHEREAS, We see in these principles the meaning of the ""no establishment clause"" of the first Amendment to the Federal Constitution as well as that of the ""Free exercise"" clause of that same amendment; it is recommended, now, therefore:	1.  The Southern Baptist Convention strongly opposes all legislation, federal and state, which would provide public grants to church colleges and universities for the construction of academic facilities, and	2.  That the Southern Baptist Convention inform each member of Congress of this action taken, and	3.  That our messengers and members be urged to support this action by personal and group communications and other appropriate contacts with their respective congressmen and all other government officials involved.",1963
"420","WHEREAS, Woman's Missionary Union, auxiliary to the Southern Baptist Convention, has just celebrated its 75th anniversary, and	WHEREAS, The Union has had as president for the past seven years a woman of unusual capabilities and a deep sense of dedication.	We therefore congratulate Woman's Missionary Union on its growth and achievements and express sincere appreciation to Mrs. R. L. Mathis for her Christian devotion through these years of leadership, and for her untiring efforts which brought us into a deeper awareness of our Baptist heritage and of our responsibility in world missions through the presentation of the 75th Anniversary Pageant.	WHEREAS, Mrs. Mathis has been elected promotion divisional director of WMU and therefore brings to a close her tenure as the Union's president and as a member of the Executive Committee of the Southern Baptist Convention,	Be it RESOLVED, That we recognize her loyal support of the Convention's total program and the strength of her leadership on Convention committees.",1963
"421","	WHEREAS, the Surgeon General's Committee appointed by President Kennedy rendered our nation a much-needed service in pointing out the hazards of cigarette smoking, which report can have far-reaching benefits to human health and well-being,	WHEREAS, the serious problem of beverage alcohol also deserves the same careful medical and scientific investigation,	We go on record as a Convention as requesting President Johnson to appoint a similar commission to investigate and to make known to our American people the hazards to personal health and to society presented by the use of alcohol as a beverage.",1964
"422","	WHEREAS, This Convention recognizes, first, that widespread distribution of the printed Word of God is a basic need in mission work around the world, and second, that missionary advance calls for even greater distribution of Bibles, New Testaments, Gospels, and other individual books of the Bible, and	WHEREAS, We recognize that the American Bible Society renders an essential worldwide missionary service through translating and publishing the Scriptures without note or comment and through distributing these without profit and usually below cost, and	WHEREAS, We recognize that the American Bible Society is planning to observe its 150th Anniversary in 1966 by launching an advanced program for greatly increased service throughout the world, emphasizing the present opportunities for a massive advance in placing the printed Word of God in the hands, hearts and lives of more people in more lands and more languages, and	WHEREAS, We recognize that the American Bible Society is rendering an additional special service through providing, without charge, to the Chaplains, Scriptures for distribution to the men and women of the Armed Forces and to patients in Veterans Hospitals.	THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That we fraternally urge all our churches and our people to make worthy contribution to the work of the American Bible Society, in order to provide the Scriptures needed for the missionary advance to which we are committed, and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Southern Baptist Convention observe the 150th Anniversary advance of the American Bible Society in 1966 with special services, emphasizing the need for a wider reading and sharing of the Holy Scriptures, and that the Executive Committee be asked to appoint a committee of five to work with the American Bible Society in making plans for this observance.",1964
"423","	The Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Atlantic City, New Jersey, expresses its deep appreciation to the Baptist Convention of Maryland, which has served as host for this Convention, for the excellent arrangements made for us, and for the gracious hospitality afforded.  To Dr. Roy D. Gresham, executive secretary, the Reverend G. W. Bullard, general chairman of arrangements, and to the hundreds of others from the convention area served by the Maryland Convention who labored many hours and days for our comfort and convenience, we acknowledge our deep gratitude.  We thank the Atlantic City Convention Bureau for their generous consideration afforded us in meeting in their city.",1964
"424","WHEREAS, The beloved executive secretary, Dr. Courts Redford, of our Home Mission Board is retiring at the end of this year, 1964; and, since this Convention in its 107th session would wish to express itself in appreciation of and affection for this noble leader,	THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That we gratefully recognize the goodness and wisdom of God in directing the choice and the labor of so effective a servant to lead Southern Baptists in their Home Mission efforts in these strategic years from 1954-1964;	That we review, with thanksgiving, the broadened base for the present and future operations of the Home Mission Board which is so largely attributable to his vision and consecration, his organizational and leadership abilities, his care and concern to reflect the mind and faithfully follow the will of his Master.	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we commend to our Convention the example of this humble and devoted churchman whose love for our Lord is the most evident thing about him, whose concern for the lost of the land is the obvious burden of his heart, whose commitment to the engaging task of claiming our nation for Christ found him imaginatively exploring additional fields, areas, methods and techniques that he might claim the most and the best for his cause, whose allegiance to his Lord is unquestioned and unexcelled, counting himself expendable for the glory of God.	RESOLUTION ON APPRECIATION FOR CONVENTION OFFICERS	As in years past, our Convention has in this year been led by some of our ablest men and women.  We are grateful to God for the dedicated leadership thus afforded us, and express our sincere appreciation to these leaders.	We are grateful to Dr. K. Owen White for his wisdom and prudence as exhibited in his handling of the presidency this year.  The Convention is aware of the inordinate demands made upon its president, and expresses deep appreciation for the service rendered by Dr. White.  To the members of the First Baptist Church of Houston, Texas, we also express our appreciation for having given us their pastor for this past year.	We acknowledge with gratitude the leadership of Vice-Presidents Paul S. James and Mrs. R. L. Mathis.  It is especially noteworthy that Mrs. Mathis is the first woman to serve as an officer of this Convention.  The service of our secretaries and our treasurer is always to be commended.  Dr. Merritt, Dr. Burton, and Dr. Routh are selfless and tireless in their services to the Convention.	Dr. James White Merritt has served as our senior secretary for the past ten years.  He has rendered a conspicuous service of dependability and accuracy in the recording and preserving of the record of our Convention.  At his request, his service to the Convention in this capacity ends with this session.	BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED, That this 107th session of the Southern Baptist Convention express its heartfelt appreciation to this devoted layman, who has served this Convention with great effectiveness.  Throughout all of the years Dr. Merritt has served us with distinction.  Faithful, devoted, conscientious, wise, and unerring, Dr. Merritt has proven a most valuable asset to our Convention.  We thank God for him and for calling him to this service.	Tribute was also paid to Miss Clara A. McCartt who, for the past twelve years, has served as assistant to the Senior Secretary of the Convention.",1964
"425","The joint effort of the Brotherhood Commission and the Home Mission Board to secure one thousand five hundred laymen in a week-end evangelistic crusade on the West Coast during July, 1964, is recognized by this Convention as a worthy effort to engage laymen in witnessing for our Lord; and	This crusade is commended to the churches and pastors of the Southern Baptist Convention as a challenging medium for laymen to serve in a holy mission for our Lord in a fertile field.	The leadership of the Holy Spirit is prayerfully sought for the laymen who participate, for the cooperating churches and missions on the West Coast and for every word spoken and every contact made in His name.	This Convention recognizes the imperative need for more laymen to join with pastors in a renewed and vital program of personal witnessing at home, throughout our nation and into all the world and join in fervent hope that the West Coast crusade will give impetus to this fundamental Christian activity.",1964
"426","In this anniversary year we are grateful for the witness which our Baptist movement has been privileged to bear.  The discernment of the call of God in Christ has led us to a glorious experience of evangelism and missionary outreach through the power of the Holy Spirit.	Our leaders and our people have firmly rejected the use of the coercive powers of government in the realm of religion.  Baptists had much to do with writing the First Amendment into the Constitution of the United States and have been in the forefront in preserving the religious liberty that our nation has enjoyed.  We have unflinchingly declared our desire for separation of church and state in resolutions, in sermons and in policies and practices.  ""In applying this principle to the field of public education, we affirm the historic right of our schools to full academic freedom for the pursuit of all knowledge, religious or otherwise.""  Motion carried.	1.  We, the messengers of the Convention hereby affirm our support for the concepts and the vocabulary of the First Amendment, including both its prohibition upon government roles in religious programs and its protection of free exercise of religion for the people.	2.  We enunciate our concern that public officials and public servants of all types shall have the same free exercise of religion as other citizens, but that this freedom does not entitle them to use public or official powers for the advancement of religious commitments or ideas.  In applying this principle to the field of public education, we affirm the historic right of our schools to full academic freedom for the pursuit of all knowledge, religious or otherwise.	3.  We appeal to the Congress of the United States to allow the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States to stand as our guarantee of religious liberty, and we oppose the adoption of any further amendment to that Constitution respecting establishment of religion of free exercise thereof.	4.  We urge all our channels, leaders, and churches to involve themselves thoroughly in study of the biblical, the historical, and the contemporary issues related to religious liberty to the end that our heritage of freedom and responsibility under God may be clearly understood and appreciated by the next generation and by ever larger proportions of the world's peoples.",1964
"427","	We are grateful to God for his gracious providence which has brought Southern Baptists to Dallas for the 1965 Convention.  The number of messengers has exceeded all previous records.  The sessions have been good and profitable.

We owe a great debt of gratitude to the press, radio, and television for their interesting, balanced and factual coverage of all sessions.	We salute Dallas and Texas Baptists and pray God's great grace to be upon them as they ""increase with the increase of God.""",1965

We extend to them our deep gratitude and sincere appreciation for sacrificial and fruitful service in the areas of responsibility given to them.	President Wayne Dehoney has given himself untiringly to the multitude of responsibilities and activities accompanying his office and has exercised unusual wisdom and dynamic leadership in the discharge of these obligations and opportunities.  The Convention desires to convey both to him and to his faithful church our most sincere gratitude for their willingness to share so freely of time, strength and talent.	Our vice presidents, Roy D. Gresham and Gregory Walcott, have at all times stood ready to assist the president in any way possible and to further the work of the Convention and its agencies.	Our secretaries, Joe W. Burton and W. Fred Kendall, and our treasurer, Porter Routh, have wrought efficiently in the responsibilities falling to them.  The Convention recognizes with sincere appreciation the fact that this year terminates nineteen years of effective secretarial service upon the part of Joe W. Burton.	To all of them, we wish to say simply, but wholeheartedly, ""We are grateful to you for a job well done in the service of our Lord.""",1965

Individual Baptists and groups of Baptists, associated by Christian bond of any nature, are urged to rededicate themselves to this task through intensifying support of the denomination's program of ""proclaiming and witnessing"" and through other appropriate individual and group action.

That this Convention urge all responsible Christian citizens to appeal to newsstand proprietors and sellers of all publications to refuse to sell such literature as appeals to prurient interests, and	2.  That in those states where there are now no laws enabling such proprietors to refuse objectionable materials from wholesalers, we strongly support the prompt enactment of such laws, and	3.  That this Convention urge the motion picture industry to reinstate and honor its own code of decency, and	4.

"432","WHEREAS, The programs and activities of the State in present day society have enlarged to the point that:	a.  	Education is apparently moving toward a practical monopoly by the State,	b.	The area of charity and public welfare is being largely preempted by the State,	c.	The dignity of man and the opportunity of minorities are being moved from an area of Christian concern and recognition into an area protected and undergirded by laws, court decrees, and other State functions, and	WHEREAS, The church still maintains its program in these areas, either independent of the State or in cooperation with the State, resulting in an inevitable complexity of the problem of Church-State relations,	Now therefore be it RESOLVED:	1.  That Southern Baptists maintain their traditional position on the separation of church and state by having a ""free church in a free state""; and that we reaffirm previous actions of Southern Baptist Conventions in expressing opposition to official relations, diplomatic or otherwise, being established between the United States and the Vatican;	2.

"436","Southern Baptists, meeting here in this cosmopolitan city of more than two million people, are reminded of our responsibility for helping to create better understanding in a pluralistic society.  We are aware of many problems that present new challenges to thoughtful believers.  We view hopefully and gratefully the signs of growing understanding and respect among all groups.	While the majority of our people are not ecumenically-minded in a structural and organizational sense, nevertheless, we rejoice with others in the present-day signs of a growing spirit of respect and goodwill among many religious bodies.  We believe that it is the will of Christ that all who believe on him should be of one accord in spirit.	We also extend our goodwill and love to non-Christian bodies and pledge ourselves anew to the defense of full religious liberty for each of them as we claim it for ourselves in every part of the world.  While differing in beliefs we recognize the sincerity of the millions who adhere to non-Christian religious views, and we would urge each and every one of our 10 3/4 million Southern Baptists to exercise understanding toward all to refrain from undue criticism of any, while steadfastly holding to the truth of Christ as revealed in the New Testament.	We feel that our commitment to the lordship of Christ requires us to demonstrate our love and concern for all others.  We find considerable encouragement to believe that the whole world may derive benefit from the fresh winds that give some promise of religious freedom for all religious bodies in all parts of the world.",1966
"437","Through the graciousness of God our Convention continues to be signally blessed with a high quality of dedicated Christian leaders who serve as our elected officers.  We thank the Lord for them and express our sincere gratitude to them.	President Wayne Dehoney has added a new dimension to the type and quality of service which a president of the Southern Baptist Convention can render.  Through the effective use of his numerous and varied talents, he has projected the image of Southern Baptists in a marvelous fashion.  Through his travels throughout the homeland and around the earth, he has brought the light of encouragement to all of us; he has undergirded and strengthened our total program and every cause of our blessed Saviour which we foster.  The vigor and vitality of his leadership has been equaled by few and excelled by none of his predecessors.  His dedication to the inspired Word of God, his loyalty to Christ, and his fidelity in performing the duties of this office have earned from us our fondest admiration.  Like the Apostle Paul he has truly ""fought a good fight and kept the faith.""  In thanking him for his service, we also thank his wife and family and the noble church of which he is pastor, the First Baptist Church, Jackson, Tennessee, for so generously sharing him with our Convention these two years.	Sharing the responsibilities of the president have been two brothers beloved who served as vice-presidents, M. B. Carroll from the West, and Leobardo Estrado from the East.  These also have served faithfully.	Clifton J. Allen in his first year as recording secretary, W. Fred Kendall, registration secretary, and Porter Routh, treasurer, have all performed the duties of their respective offices in a most efficient manner.	To all of these, our Convention officers, we say, ""Well done, thou good and faithful servants.""",1966

"440","In the historic Baptist concern for religious liberty the separation of the state from the church has been and continues to be an important policy.	In view of the renewed efforts to change the effect of the First Amendment, this Convention reaffirms the resolution adopted in 1964 with reference to the adequacy of the First Amendment as the legal basis for implementing our concern.  We continue to oppose any and all attempts to modify this guarantee against establishments of religions and against interference with the free exercise of religion.	The importance of the policy of separation of church and state is increased rather than diminished by the overlappings of public concerns with church concerns, and by the numerous complexities associated with public provisions for health, welfare, and education.	In view of the increasing complexity of public programs of fiscal support, we commend the state conventions and the institutional trustees that have undertaken careful analyses of institutional policies with a view to the safeguarding of our historic concern for these principles.  We likewise commend the Education Commission for launching a broadly representative study of contemporary denominational programs and needs in higher education.	We urge all who plan or operate religious activities to refrain from seeking public funds for the advancement of sectarian causes.  We also urge all public agencies that support educational, health, or welfare activities of any kind to safeguard against the use of public funds for the support of, or the advancement of sectarian causes, purposes, or projects.",1966
