RESOLUTION ON OUR GRATITUDE AND COMMITMENT	As Southern Baptists meeting in Philadelphia, a city of historic significance in the beginning of our nation and in the beginning of Baptist life in North America, we are keenly aware that God has richly blessed us across many years.	As we look back upon our rich heritage, and humbly thank God for his mercies to us in the past, we are made to realize that there is much happening among us in these days for which we must give thanks in this Convention.	We are grateful for the evidence of a new interest in evangelism that is spreading among us, and for the increased harvest of souls won to the Lord.	We are grateful for the renewed response to the Lordship of Christ among the youth in our churches and for the fresh enthusiasm and challenge which they bring to all of us.",1972
"WHEREAS, The gross moral depravity pictured in many of today's movies is utterly degrading and lacking in redeeming social value; and	WHEREAS, The Columbia Broadcasting System in February broke a critically important moral barrier by releasing for the first time for showing on television an edited version of ""The Damned,"" a previously X-rated movie, so that there is imminent danger that morally offensive movies may now be channeled more frequently into American homes,	THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That this Convention hereby expresses its indignation toward those producers of movie pornography, those vindicators of movie violence, and those merchants of movie immorality who for profit prey on the public, both feeding on the people's basest cravings and building an appetite for ever baser excesses, and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That for the sake of society and in the name of the most elementary decency, we call on movie producers, distributors, and exhibitors to exercise greater moral judgment and far more moral restraint in the making and showing of movies; and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we declare our conviction that television programs which degrade sex, glorify violence, and deny moral decency have no place on the airwaves; and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we endorse movie production and television programming which provide wholesome entertainment and that we vigorously oppose that which undermines the moral values and ideals without which no nation can long endure, and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we call on Southern Baptists to communicate appreciation to producers, networks, and sponsors for movies and television programs that are morally wholesome, and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we call on Southern Baptists to express themselves in opposition to the showing of offensive movies both in theaters and on television through letter writing, selective buying practices, selective viewing, the publishing of the names of offending companies in newspaper ads, and a concerted call to legislators for clear legislation that will prohibit the exhibition of obscenity either in movies or on television, and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we view this issue with so much seriousness that we pledge ourselves to work to secure its implementation.

"WHEREAS, There is a massive campaign on state and national levels to tax all citizens to finance education in parochial schools, President Nixon has pledged to find ways of channeling tax funds to parochial schools or their students, and tax credit and voucher plans are now receiving major attention;	WHEREAS, Philadelphia is a good setting in which to recall that abusive taxation and other arbitrary acts of government led to the creation of a system of government which guarantees the free exercise of religion and pledges that it shall do nothing respecting an establishment of religion;	WHEREAS, Our Baptist forefathers took an active role in opposing Virginia's assessment bill to tax all citizens to support education under church direction, in establishing that government's taxing power would abuse religious liberty if used for this purpose, and in writing the First Amendment into the United States Constitution;	WHEREAS, The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment was designed to protect religious liberty against government's interference or control and the Establishment Clause was designed, as the United States Supreme Court said since the last annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention, to protect against the ""evils"" of government's sponsorship of religion, government's financial support of religion, government's active involvement in religious activity, and political division along religious lines;	WHEREAS, The United States Supreme Court and lower courts have knocked down numerous parochial school aid proposals within the last year and have made it clear that public control goes with public funds; and	WHEREAS, Any comprehensive system of tax credits or vouchers to underwrite parochial and private education would burden taxpayers with the costs of institutions and activities serving a non-public purpose, threaten each citizen's freedom against taxation for religious and non-public purposes, endanger the religious character of parochial schools themselves, and tend to weaken public schools open to all without respect to religion, race, creed, color, or national origin;	Be it therefore RESOLVED, By the Southern Baptist Convention in annual session at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, June 6-8, 1972, that we renew our commitment to religious freedom and its corollary, no establishment of religion; affirm our belief that religion flourishes best without government's interference or its tax support; caution schools directly or indirectly connected with this Convention to give serious study to the high price which government usually exacts for its favors; call on our people to support the institutions which serve our religious objectives; voice our earnest protest against being taxed to finance educational and other activities or churches; and express our thanks to God for courts which uphold the First Amendment against the enormous political pressures of our time;	Be it further RESOLVED, That we request the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs to keep our people informed on this subject and that we request educational agencies of this Convention to take appropriate steps, according to each agency's commission, to maintain perennial education on this vital subject; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That we request the president of this Convention to send copies of this resolution to President Nixon and to Justices of the United States Supreme Court, and that we request the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs to send copies to members of the United States Congress and to other public officials of its choosing, and that we request the Baptist Press and Baptist papers to give it prime coverage.",1972

"WHEREAS, Complex social forces have brought many to depend on government welfare for their subsistence, and	WHEREAS, There is often confusion about the validity of welfare and sometimes hostility toward welfare recipients, and	WHEREAS, The present welfare system is a tangle of bureaucratic regulations and often ineffective programs which stand in need of reform, and	WHEREAS, Christians have a Bible-taught responsibility to help those who are in need in a manner that will maintain the dignity and worth of even the least and poorest, and	WHEREAS, The true issues of welfare are often hidden behind cliches which perpetuate welfare myths,	Therefore, be it RESOLVED, That we urge Southern Baptists to support federal welfare reform legislation which may adequately financially help the many people in need of:  job training for those able to work and the maintenance of the dignity of those who are forced because they are very young, very old, very sick, or severely incapacitated to depend on welfare for their existence.",1972

Mrs. Myra Bates, the second woman to be elected a vice-president of the Convention, has given us leadership with charm and vitality.  The Convention expresses its deepest thanks for their services.

"Jack Harwell (Ga.) presented the report of the Committee on Baptist State Papers, in behalf of Chairman H. Franklin Paschall (Tenn.), and moved its adoption.  The motion passed.	REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON BAPTIST STATE PAPERS	Some of the most illustrious names in Southern Baptist history are directly and significantly related to the promotion of Baptist state papers.  Who can forget the ringing call of George W. Truett, L. R. Scarborough, E. C. Routh, and Louie D. Newton to Southern Baptists to support Baptist state papers with increasing fervor and deepening devotion?  Your Committee on Baptist State Papers considers it an honor and privilege as well as an awesome responsibility to follow in their train.  They believed, and so do we, that the work of Southern Baptists will prosper to that extent it is articulated and supported by these papers.  It is still true that no other publication among us can do what Baptist state papers have done, are doing, and, pray God will always do.	Whatever vital issue confronts our Convention, it is clarified and expounded in the Baptist state papers.  Beloved, let no one be mistaken, the influence of these papers is far reaching and constructive.	From its beginning, the Committee on Baptist State Papers has been concerned with circulation.  The combined circulation of the nineteen Baptist state papers in 1940 was 190,683; in 1945 it had increased to 547,254; by 1955 to 1,157,444; and by 1965 to 1,540,260.  In 1976 the total circulation was 1,852,826.  The goal of two million readers by 1980 gives us a challenge which we must face in this Convention.  The best response we can make to this challenging goal is to get Baptist state papers into more church budgets.  Every church which includes its Baptist state paper in the budget prospers from it.  Louie D. Newton has said to Baptists of Georgia that if a church will include The Christian Index in its budget for one year, and if at the end of that year the pastor and the people feel that it has not been worthwhile, if they will send him the bill, he will pay what it has cost the church.  His testimony is that he has never been asked to pay a bill.	Your Committee on Baptist State Papers, therefore, recommends that:	(1)  We hold before us the goal of two million in circulation by 1980;		We profit from the readership survey which is now underway by the 	        Research Services Department of the Sunday School Board;	 (3)  This committee be continued to study the results of the survey and to make further                             recommendations for the improvement and enhancement of the ministry of Baptist state                    papers.

"Television possesses tremendous potential.  Like the printing press and the automobile, television can be used for either good or bad.  Southern Baptists rejoice at the contributions television has made to American life while we lament the damage that television has done.  Southern Baptists have a responsibility to help harness television's potential for moral good and to help check its potential for moral evil.  The Christian Life Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, in accordance with its program responsibility for Christian morality development, presents five recommendations.	(1)  We recommend that the Southern Baptist Convention now courageously confront television's moral challenge.  This moral challenge is being flung at us by socially irresponsible television policy makers, profiteering advertisers, duty-shirking public officials, and most of all by apathetic television viewers.  Christians fail God and fall short of his purposes for us when we tolerate television's trash.  Moreover, television fails us and it fails itself when it dumps into our homes a steady stream of illicit sex, casual violence, alcohol promotion, materialism, vulgarity, blasphemy, cursing, and the dead-end notion that everyone should ""eat, drink, and be merry"" (Luke 12:19) for ""tomorrow we die"" (1 Cor. 15:32).  Let Southern Baptists courageously confront television's moral challenge.	(2)  We recommend that the Southern Baptist Convention encourage our churches to begin in August carefully to utilize the Christian Life Commission's special study materials being mailed to every pastor, along with other trustworthy resources, to evaluate the impact of television on our lives, our families, our churches, and our society.  Let Southern Baptists evaluate television's impact.	(3)  We recommend that the Southern Baptist Convention give its support to a special effort in all Southern Baptist churches throughout the month of September to encourage our members to exercise careful moral judgment regarding television, determining in advance which programs to watch and which programs not to watch in the knowledge that if we do not control television, television will control us.  Christians cannot indiscriminately give television our eyes, our minds, and our time because our God is a jealous God who will have no other gods before Him (Ex. 20:3), and believers have ""one Master, even Christ"" (Matt. 23:8).  Let Southern Baptists use moral discernment regarding television.	(4)  We recommend that the Southern Baptist Convention encourage our people to use the month of October for special communication with those who are responsible for television programming.  (A)  Communicate with the advertisers who will pay attention when Christians buy products whose makers sponsor good programs and refuse to buy products whose makers sponsor bad programs.  (B)  Communicate with network officials:  pray for them; write them; call them; reason with them; plead with them; commend them for the good; hold them responsible for the bad; and remember that ancient Rome at first had no earthly intention of paying any real attention to the early Christians.  (C)  Communicate with the local television station officials; write them; call them; visit them; share both your moral support and your moral outrage with them; and remind them of their moral obligation to the community.  (D)  Communicate with your Senators and Congressperson, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, and the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission to plead for their support on behalf of the rising tide of public concern for morality in television programming.  Let Southern Baptists communicate our convictions about television.	(5)  We recommend that the Southern Baptist Convention, especially during the year immediately ahead, encourage our churches and our people to act together and in cooperation with others who share our deep moral concern about current television programming to bring about needed changes in television.  Southern Baptists possess awesome moral power but we can accomplish the objective of substantially improved television programming much more quickly and fully through a strongly united witness.  Let Southern Baptists unite with each other and with others in a concerted effort to support the good and to eradicate the evil in television.	Television represents an immensely important aspect of modern life desperately needing Southern Baptists' moral salt and moral light.  Let Southern Baptists act.  Let Southern Baptists act now.  Let Southern Baptists make a great, aggressive, positive, united, visible, optimistic effort to affect television for God and for good.

"Preamble:  Human rights is a major moral issue of our time.  It has captured the attention of the world.  Introduced into the political equation, it has threatened world peace on the one hand and engendered new hope for the oppressed on the other.  Widespread abuses of human rights have helped create a rising tide of concern for the poor, for minorities, for dissenters, and for political prisoners.  Baptist churches have a stake in the issue of human rights, for our own Baptist history and heritage have been formed in a crucible which has both demanded and produced human rights.	Definition:  Southern Baptists believe that humanity is created by God in God's own image (Genesis 1:26-27).  We believe that in Jesus Christ, God ""so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life"" (John 3:16).  We believe, as our nation's founders said in the Declaration of Independence, that all persons ""are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.""  And we believe with the framers of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights that human rights include freedom from involuntary servitude, arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, torture, unfair trial, cruel and unusual punishment, and invasion of privacy; rights to family life, property, work, and equal pay for equal work as well as food, shelter, health care, and education; and freedom of thought, speech, assembly, religion, movement, and participation in government.	Biblical Basis:  Southern Baptists stand for the worth of the individual, the priesthood of the believer, freedom of conscience, and the sanctity of life.  We hold that these human rights are the gift of God.  We believe that they spring from the Bible's revelation that all persons are made in ""the likeness of God"" (James 3:9, RSV).  We believe that they are vitally related to Christ's life and work and death and resurrection whereby, ""having slain the enmity"" (Ephesians 2:16) by bringing alienation and hostility to an end, He brought into being a new humanity oriented toward ""new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness"" (2 Peter 3:13).  We believe that they coincide with the Bible's teachings in support of justice, mercy, peace, and righteousness.  We believe that every human being has basic human rights which may not rightly be relinquished, abridged, or denied.  Moreover, we believe that Jesus Christ revealed His own support for human rights when He declared, ""The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor.  He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord"" (Luke 4:18-19, RSV).	Scope:  Today we are confronted with abuses of human rights at home and abroad.  As in the days of the prophets, God has looked for justice among the people of the earth and too often has found exploitation; He has looked for peace and too often has found bloodshed; He has looked for righteousness and too often has found the cry of the poor, the hungry, the orphaned, the widowed, and the oppressed (Psalm 10:18; Isaiah 1:23, 3:14-15; Amos 26-7; James 1:27-2:1-9).  We are gravely concerned about the widespread denial of human rights at the hands of our political allies as well as our political adversaries.  Our concern for tortured, unjustly imprisoned, and politically oppressed persons abroad is matched by our concern for the rights of women, blacks, ethnic minorities, the poor, the aging, the sick, and abused children in our midst.  Christians are obligated not only to provide in Jesus' name cups of cold water for individuals whose human rights have been violated, but also to deal in a forthright and corrective way with social structures which abuse and violate human rights.  We are determined not to take our own rights and freedoms so lightly that we ignore the rights and freedoms of others no matter how far away or how small or weak they are; and we are determined to be courageous defenders of human rights who will not be deterred in the fight to make all people free.	Call to Action:  We therefore issue this call to action on behalf of human rights.	Let Southern Baptist citizens be committed to political action on behalf of human rights at home and abroad, responsibly involving ourselves as God's salt, God's light, and God's leaven in the whole political process.	Let Southern Baptist pastors, knowing that ""where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty"" (Corinthians 3:17), preach the Word of God without fear or favor as it highlights human rights.	Let Southern Baptist churches be boldly involved in championing justice for the oppressed, providing food for the hungry, supporting changes in those laws and systems which abuse the poor while providing loopholes for the rich, doing the things that make for peace, and effecting change where change is needed to support basic human rights.	Let Southern Baptist agencies demonstrate by words and deeds an unswerving loyalty to Christ issuing in uncompromised and uncompromising commitment to human rights.	Let Southern Baptists not be weighed and found wanting in commitment to God-given and Bible-based human rights.  Let us heed Jesus who said, ""I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, and I was naked and you clothed me.  I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me . . . As you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me"" (Matthew 25:35-36, 40, RSV).	Recommendations:  The Christian Life Commission recommends the adoption of this Declaration.",1978

Therefore, be it RESOLVED, That we not decide concerns of Christians doctrine and practice by modern cultural, sociological, and ecclesiastical trends or by emotional factors; that we remind ourselves of the dearly bought Baptist principle of the final authority of Scripture in matters of faith and conduct; and that we encourage the service of women in all aspects of church life and work other than pastoral functions and leadership roles entailing ordination.",1984

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That we, the messengers of the Southern Baptist Convention, meeting in St. Louis, Missouri, June 16-18, 1987, recognize that the crisis needs of runaway, homeless, and missing children should be given high priority by churches, private citizens, legislators, and government officials; and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That those needs are best served by carefully structured private programs under legal guidelines established by state law; and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we encourage strict confidentiality for children and families served by the program, strong requirements for family notification within hours and family reunification within days, and clear legal protection for private individuals, churches, and organizations providing good faith crisis help to homeless and runaway children; and	BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED, That crisis programs for children should, while respecting the religious backgrounds of the children served, make special efforts to provide as much for their spiritual and emotional needs as for their physical wants.",1987

"WHEREAS, The Southern Baptist Convention has spoken on numerous occasions about the harmful effects of pornography; and	WHEREAS, The pornography industry is a multi-billion dollar industry which contributes to many harmful effects in society; and	WHEREAS, New technologies have made possible obscene communications such as ""Dial-a-Porn,"" a sexually-explicit telephone conversation conducted for commercial gain; and	WHEREAS, The primary users of such obscene communication appear to be America's teenagers; and	WHEREAS, Pornographic and sexually explicit films are offered for viewing in hotels and motels, of which the Holiday Inn chain is the largest offender; and	WHEREAS, Obscene communication has never been protected under our Constitution.

Therefore, Be it RESOLVED, That we, the messengers of the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in St. Louis, Missouri, June 16-18, 1987, encourage parents to become involved in the sex education process through	1)  Sensitivity to the sexual development and learning needs of their own children;	2)  Involvement in and communication with their local educational process in review and selection of educational materials; and	3)  Participation in the political process by which our state legislators would be encouraged to mandate the teaching in the public schools of sexual abstinence until marriage and to reject all forms of legislation that would require teaching the acceptability of the practices of promiscuous and perverse lifestyles.	Be it further RESOLVED, That Southern Baptists encourage our churches	1)  To preach the biblical basis for human sexuality and	2)  To strengthen the stand of parents and educators within our congregations;	Be it finally RESOLVED, That the Southern Baptist Convention encourage and urge our schools and educators to	1)  Adopt curricula that stress traditional family roles as the ideal;	2)  Adopt curricula that are true, healthy, legal, and constitutional;	3)  Adopt a policy to establish a parental review process in advance of program implementation.  That process should be open and effectual, including dividing classes that address sex education into male and female groups and providing parents with the option to choose for their child not to participate;	4)  Adopt curricula that teach sexual abstinence before marriage and fidelity in marriage as the only acceptable lifestyle in terms of public health as this is the best and only sure way crisis pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases can be prevented;	5)  Refrain from distribution of condoms and other contraceptive materials; and	6)  Oppose the establishment of school based clinics which provide sexual counseling.",1987

"WHEREAS, The issue of institutional childcare in our society is being widely debated and numerous proposals have been set forth in bills pending in Congress; and	WHEREAS, Some tax subsidy proposals for childcare discriminate against families who choose home childcare by taxing all families to subsidize government-approved day care facilities; and	WHEREAS, Some of the legislation proposed would tend to benefit two-wage earner families, who generally have a higher income level than one-wage earner families; and	WHEREAS, Some of these proposals involve sensitive matters concerning church-state relations, specifically the availability of federal funds for childcare institutions which are sponsored by churches; and	WHEREAS, Part of the debate revolves around the appropriate federal role in stimulating growth in the availability of institutional childcare services.

"WHEREAS, A major contribution to the demise of many Protestant denominations has been their loss of a clear understanding of, and commitment to, the biblical doctrine of salvation; and	WHEREAS, Some believe that people can be saved apart from the atoning work of Jesus Christ, arguing rather for a plurality of mediators; and	WHEREAS, Some vacillate on the necessity of conversion for all people; and	WHEREAS, Some teach that Jesus Christ did not come to save us, but to let us know that we already live in the arms of God's grace, implying that all people are already saved; and	WHEREAS, Some believe that people will be saved because their good works outweigh their bad; and	WHEREAS, Some believe that hell is not a reality, and its corollary, that all people will eventually be saved; and	WHEREAS, Some believe that the content and mission of the church need no longer focus on missions and evangelism, having abandoned the belief in a conversion theology.	BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED, That we, the messengers of the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in San Antonio, Texas, June 14-16, 1988, affirm our belief in the biblical truths, that, although we agree that every person possesses dignity and is worthy of respect and Christian love, we also believe that as soon as people are capable of moral action, they become transgressors and are under condemnation, that is, they are lost; and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we affirm Article IV (A) of the 1963 Baptist Faith and Message Statement which reads as follows:  ""Regeneration, or the new birth, is a work of God's grace whereby believers become new creatures in Christ Jesus.  It is a change of heart wrought by the Holy Spirit through conviction of sin, to which the sinner responds in repentance toward God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ""; and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we believe that salvation is not analogous to having a positive self image or possessing self-esteem as desirable as these may be; and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we affirm our belief in the biblical truth that salvation is offered freely to all who accept Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord; and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we affirm our belief in the biblical truth that all who are saved are sealed by the Holy Spirit and will never fall away from the state of grace; and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we affirm our belief in the biblical truth that those without a personal commitment to Jesus Christ will be consigned to a literal hell, the place of everlasting separation from God according to the Word of God; and	BE IT THEREFORE FINALLY RESOLVED, That because of the aforementioned convictions that all Southern Baptists give renewed efforts to implementing and supporting Bold Mission Thrust as the priority of the individual Christian, the local church, and the Southern Baptist Convention.	RESOLUTION ON THE PRIESTHOOD OF THE BELIEVER	WHEREAS, None of the five major writing systematic theologians in Southern Baptist history have given more than passing reference to the doctrine of the priesthood of the believer in their systematic theologies; and	WHEREAS, The Baptist Faith and Message preamble refers to the priesthood of the believer, but provides no definition or content to the term; and	WHEREAS, The high profile emphasis on the doctrine of the priesthood of the believer in Southern Baptist life is a recent historical development; and 	WHEREAS, The priesthood of the believer is a term which is subject to both misunderstanding and abuse; and	WHEREAS, The doctrine of the priesthood of the believer has been used to justify wrongly the attitude that a Christian may believe whatever he so chooses and still be considered a loyal Southern Baptist; and	WHEREAS, The doctrine of the priesthood of the believer can be used to justify the undermining of pastoral authority in the local church.	BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED, That the Southern Baptist Convention, meeting in San Antonio, Texas, June 14-16, 1988, affirm its belief in the biblical doctrine of the priesthood of the believer (1 Peter 2:9 and Revelation 1:6); and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we affirm that this doctrine in no way gives license to misinterpret, explain away, demythologize, or extrapolate out elements of the supernatural from the Bible; and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the doctrine of the priesthood of the believer in on way contradicts the biblical understanding of the role, responsibility, and authority of the pastor which is seen in the command to the local church in Hebrews 13:17, ""Obey your leaders, and submit to them; for they keep watch over your souls, as those who will give an account;"" and	BE FINALLY RESOLVED, That we affirm the truth that elders, or pastors, are called of God to lead the local church (Acts 20:28).",1988

Therefore, be it RESOLVED, That we, the messengers of the Southern Baptist Convention, meeting in San Antonio, Texas, June 14-16, 1988, acknowledge the New Age movement's aim to become a one-world religion is diametrically contrary to both New Testament Christianity and our American heritage; and	Be it finally RESOLVED, That we encourage our Convention agencies, local associations, pastors, and church staffs to warn and educate our Baptist constituency of the deception and critical dangers of this movement.",1988
"WHEREAS, Organ procurement for transplantation falls far short of demand; and	WHEREAS, Organ transplant technology has transformed many lives from certain death to vibrant productivity; and	WHEREAS, A Gallup poll reported in the New York Times May 3, 1987, that 82% of respondents would donate adult relatives' organs in appropriate situations, but only 20% had completed a donor card; and	WHEREAS, Complete resurrection of the body does not depend on bodily wholeness at death; and	WHEREAS, The values of a godless society promote self-sufficiency to such a degree that people are indifferent to the needs of others, as seen in resistance to organ donations; and	WHEREAS, Organ donation for research or transplantation is a matter of personal conscience.

"WHEREAS, None of the five major writing systematic theologians in Southern Baptist history have given more than passing reference to the doctrine of the priesthood of the believer in their systematic theologies; and	WHEREAS, The Baptist Faith and Message preamble refers to the priesthood of the believer, but provides no definition or content to the term; and	WHEREAS, The high profile emphasis on the doctrine of the priesthood of the believer in Southern Baptist life is a recent historical development; and	WHEREAS, The priesthood of the believer is a term which is subject to both misunderstanding and abuse; and	WHEREAS, The doctrine of the priesthood of the believer has been used to justify wrongly the attitude that a Christian may believe whatever he so chooses and still be considered a loyal Southern Baptist; and	WHEREAS, The doctrine of the priesthood of the believer can be used to justify the undermining of pastoral authority in the local church.	Be it therefore RESOLVED, That the Southern Baptist Convention, meeting in San Antonio, Texas, June 14-16, 1988, affirm its belief in the biblical doctrine of the priesthood of the believer (1 Peter 2:9 and Revelation 1:6); and	Be it further RESOLVED, That we affirm that this doctrine in no way gives license to misinterpret, explain away, demythologize, or extrapolate out elements of the supernatural from the Bible; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That the doctrine of the priesthood of the believer in no way contradicts the biblical understanding of the role, responsibility, and authority of the pastor which is seen in the command to the local church in Hebrews 13:17, ""Obey your leaders, and submit to them; for they keep watch over your souls, as those who will give an account;"" and	Be finally RESOLVED, That we affirm the truth that elders, or pastors, are called of God to lead the local church (Acts 20:28).",1988
"WHEREAS, Abortion on demand was legalized by the United States Supreme Court on January 22, 1973; and	WHEREAS, Over 22 million innocent unborn American children have died by legalized abortion since that date; and	WHEREAS, Most Southern Baptist church members are firmly opposed to the aforementioned Supreme Court decision, understanding that that which is legal in this case is not moral; and	WHEREAS, The trustees of the Home Mission Board have created a staff position of Coordinator of Alternatives to Abortion Ministries to help Southern Baptists devleop ministries of Abortion Alternatives Outreach; and	WHEREAS, The trustees of the Christian Life Commission have adopted a firm policy opposing abortion except to prevent the death of the mother, which policy states, in part, that ""Human life, from fertilization until natural death, is sacred and should be protected, not destroyed""; and	WHEREAS, The trustees of the Sunday School Board have adopted a plan to publish annual, dated lessons opposing abortion on Sanctity of Human Life Sunday.

"WHEREAS, A continuing permissive attitude in contemporary society toward extramarital sexual activity has precipitated an epidemic of teenage pregnancy; and	WHEREAS, Many public school systems across America believe that the most effective way to combat to this problem is to make birth control information and contraceptives widely available to public school students; and	WHEREAS, This mindset has led to the provision of amoral counsel, of contraceptive medications, and devices within the framework of public schools; and	WHEREAS, The newest assault on parental authority and responsibility with respect to their adolescent children is the concept of School Based Clinics, which are being introduced into public schools across the country with the ostensible reason being to provide general medical services to public school students; and	WHEREAS, Many proponents of School Based Clinics claim that contraceptive services and treatment of sexually-related medical conditions are only a small portion of the total services to be delivered, it is obvious because of the philosophical base of their chief proponents that general medical services are only a camouflage for their primary motivation which is to provide contraceptives to public schools students; and 	WHEREAS, Provision of contraceptive services in School Based Clinics is virtually always done under the cover of patient confidentiality, resulting in the provision of contraceptive services, medications, and devices without parental knowledge or permission, undermining God-ordained parental authority and responsibility; and	WHEREAS, This causes the public school, which represents to students the authority of the government and of the community at large, to condone immoral sexual behavior; and	WHEREAS, That for public schools to condone and lend assistance to immoral sexual behavior is an abdication of moral responsibility and a breach of the trust which parents expect from those to whom they entrust the education of their children.	Therefore be it RESOLVED, That we, the messengers of the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in San Antonio, Texas, June 14-16, 1988, abhor the tendency to bypass parental consent involving birth control and abortion; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That we deplore the operation of School Based Clinics which have as any part of their function the provision of contraceptive counseling, medications, or devices; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That we do not believe that any fair interpretation of the doctrine of separation of church and state requires the public schools of our nation to adopt and maintain an amoral value-free approach to teenage promiscuity, and we call for public schools as they deal with the sensitive areas of sexual behavior to uphold the standard of sexual abstinence outside marriage; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That we support those public school educators in their efforts to promote traditional moral values that teach abstinence; and	Be it finally RESOLVED, That if ""Just Say No"" is the standard for drug education, we affirm that it is equally applicable to sex education.",1988

Wade decision, and its progeny, denied the right of the fifty state legislatures and the Congress to protect the preborn child by law; and	WHEREAS, the Court may now be willing to permit the states and the Congress once again to enact legislation regulating and restricting abortion.	Therefore, be it RESOLVED, That we, the messengers of the Southern Baptist Convention, meeting in Las Vegas, June 13-15, 1989, do strongly urge the fifty state legislatures and the Congress to enact legislation to restrict the practice of induced abortion; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That we urge the Christian Life Commission and the various state Baptist conventions, and their Christian Life Committees, affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention actively to promote the passage of such legislation; and	Be it finally RESOLVED, That we do reaffirm our opposition to legalized abortion and our support of appropriate federal and state legislation and/or constitutional amendment which will prohibit abortion except to prevent the imminent death of the mother.",1989

Therefore, Be it RESOLVED, That we the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention, meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana, June 9-11, 1992, urge the President of the United States to use the influence afforded by the successful outcome of the Persian Gulf war to influence all nations throughout the region of the Middle East to provide genuine religious freedom for the estimated 10 million Christians living in the Middle East, for the foreign nationals who must work in those nations, and for all persons everywhere; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That we reaffirm our historic tradition of support for the God-given, inalienable right to religious freedom for all peoples of the world, and our conviction that political freedom, self-determination, and economic freedom are the necessary corollaries to religious liberty.",1992

"WHEREAS, Homosexuality is immoral, contrary to the Bible (Lev. 18:22; 1 Cor. 6:9-10) and contrary to traditional Judeo-Christian moral standards, and the open affirmation of homosexuality represents a sign of God's surrendering a society to its perversions (Rom. 1:18-32); and	WHEREAS, Open and avowed homosexuality is incompatible with the requirements of military service according to high ranking military leaders and most military personnel; and	WHEREAS, Homosexual conduct is inconsistent with the Uniform Code of Military Justice and is detrimental to morale, unit cohesion, good order, discipline, and mission accomplishment; and	WHEREAS, Homosexuality in the military would endanger the life and health of military personnel by the increased exposure to sexually transmitted diseases and by enhanced danger of tainted blood in battlefield conditions; and	WHEREAS, Open homosexuality in the military would have significant adverse impact on the Pentagon's budget including medical, legal and social costs; and	WHEREAS, Southern Baptist and other evangelical military chaplains may be pressured to compromise the essential gospel message, withhold their biblical convictions about this sexual perversion and submit to sensitivity training"" concerning homosexuality if openly declared homosexuals are permitted to serve; and	WHEREAS, Southern Baptists and other evangelical members of the armed forces will be placed in compromising environments which will violate their conscience if the ban is lifted and will discourage other potential evangelical recruits from serving in the armed forces; and	WHEREAS, Homosexual politics is masquerading today as ""civil rights,"" in order to exploit the moral high ground of the civil rights movement even though homosexual conduct and other learned sexual deviance have nothing in common with the moral movement to stop discrimination against race and gender; and	WHEREAS, Government should not give special legal protection and endorsement to homosexuality, nor impose legal sanctions against those who believe homosexual conduct to be immoral.	Therefore, Be It RESOLVED, That we, the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention, meeting at Houston, Texas, June 15-17, 1993, affirm the biblical truth that homosexuality is sin, as well as the biblical promise that all persons, including homosexuals, can receive abundant, new and eternal life by repenting of their sin and trusting Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord (1 Cor. 6:11); and	Be it further RESOLVED, That we oppose all effort to provide government endorsement, sanction, recognition, acceptance, or civil rights advantage on the basis of homosexuality; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That we oppose lifting the ban on homosexuals serving in the armed forces, and that we support passage of any legislation before Congress which restores and inforces the ban; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That we deplore acts of hatred or violence committed by homosexuals against those who take a stand for traditional morality as well as acts of hatred or violence committed against homosexuals; and	Be it finally RESOLVED, That we express our profound pride in and support of those who serve in the United States military, and for our chaplains in the military as they perform their ministry based on biblical principles and moral convictions, in an increasingly tumultuous environment.",1993
"WHEREAS, The fundamental truth of Christianity is that ""God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself"" (II Cor. 5:19); and	WHEREAS, From beginning to end the Bible proclaims salvation through Jesus Christ and no other (1 Tim. 2:5); and	WHEREAS, Both our Lord Himself and the apostles He sent forth into the religiously pluralistic environment of the first century proclaimed without apology the exclusive claims of Jesus Christ as the only way to the Father, calling on all persons everywhere to repent or perish (Luke 13:3; John 14:6; Acts 4:12); and	WHEREAS, Although God has disclosed himself genuinely in all cultures through the created order and the human conscience, this general revelation has been so perverted by sin as to leave all persons utterly destitute of any hope of salvation outside of personal repentance and faith in the Redeemer (Rom. 1-2); and	WHEREAS, The Christian church is not confronted with various schemes of universalism, radical pluralism, theological inclusivism, and religious relativism, all of which call into question the clear teaching of Holy Scripture and historic Baptist belief in the particularity and finality of the revelation and salvific work of Jesus Christ; and	WHEREAS, Christianity is often presented in the context of world religions as merely one of the many expressions of humanity's religious consciousness, all of which are seen as independently valid ways of knowing God; and	WHEREAS, Theological accommodation in this critical area of faith and doctrine seriously compromises our evangelistic witness and missionary outreach to the lost.	WHEREAS, This session of the Southern Baptist Convention coincides with the very week which marks the 200th anniversary of William Carey's departure from England for India for the express purpose of ""propagating the gospel""; and	Therefore, Be it RESOLVED, That the messengers to the 136th session of the Southern Baptist Convention, affirm biblical teaching concerning the uniqueness of Jesus Christ as the sole and sufficient Savior for all persons who have lived or ever shall be, understanding that the redeemed are justified by grace through faith in our Lord who on the cross personally bore the penalty of our sin in His body and purchased our redemption by His blood; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That we oppose the false teaching that Christ is so evident in world religions, human consciousness or the natural process that one can encounter Him and find salvation without the direct means of the gospel, or that adherents of the non-Christian religions and world views can receive this salvation through any means other than personal repentance and faith in Jesus Christ, the only Savior; and	Be it finally RESOLVED, That we confess Jesus Christ as the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and that we commit ourselves to proclaim the good news of eternal life through Jesus Christ to everyone everywhere, including the 1.3 billion persons who have never heard the name of Christ for the first time, to the end that souls may be saved for eternity and God glorified in ever increasing measure.",1993
"WHEREAS, Religious freedom has long been a Baptist distinctive, integral to Baptist faith and practice; and 	WHEREAS, Religious freedom was a distinctively Baptist contribution as formulated in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; and	WHEREAS, Religious freedom has suffered severe erosion in the last half of the century, especially in America's public school policies, partly as a result of errant interpretations of the First Amendment Establishment Clause to require extreme ""strict separation of church and state,"" which can accommodate only arid secularism in public school policies rather than accommodating religious pluralism; and	WHEREAS, In Lee v. Weisman, 1992, the U.S. Supreme Court banned public school commencement prayers which were faculty-initiated and directed; and	WHEREAS, Prior Supreme Court decisions have held that accommodation of religious expression in public schools does not violate church/state separation.	Therefore, be it RESOLVED, That we, the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention, meeting in Houston, Texas, June 15-17, 1993, decry the decision in Lee v. Weisman for failing to accommodate the religious traditions of the community, and for holding instead that prayers by a private citizen were necessarily school-sponsored and coercive, in a lopsided emphasis on ""strict separation"" rather than religious freedom; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That we affirm the interpretation of Lee by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which permitted student-initiated, student-led prayer at commencements and other public school-related events, and commend the Supreme Court for leaving undisturbed the Fifth Circuit decision (Jones v. Clear Creek Independent School District, 1992); and	Be it further RESOLVED, That we call upon the courts and public officials not to blur the distinction between government action, which the Constitution may prohibit, and private religious expression, which the Constitution must protect; and	Be it finally RESOLVED, That we call upon Southern Baptist parents, students, teachers, and officials in public schools to work aggressively for full and free accommodation of prayer and religious expression in public school policies, including public school-related events.",1993
"WHEREAS, Southern Baptists are on record as abhorring racial and ethnic injustice; and	WHEREAS, The practice of so-called ""ethnic cleansing"" continues to plague the world, as demonstrated by the recent atrocities in the Balkans; and	WHEREAS, The central message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is reconciliation to God, which should result in reconciliation to other persons regardless of racial, ethnic, social, and economic differences; and	WHEREAS, Southern Baptists are committed to taking this reconciling Gospel to all the world.	Therefore, be it RESOLVED, That we, the messengers of the Southern Baptist Convention, meeting in Houston, Texas, June 15-17, 1993, express our gratitude to God for his reconciling grace, and reaffirm our intention to love our neighbors as ourselves, denouncing in strongest terms every expression of racial and ethnic prejudice, discrimination, and hatred; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That we call upon our President and other leaders of the international community to work to end genocide wherever found; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That we call upon federal, state, and local government to enforce fully civil rights laws when such laws are in accordance with the Word of God, and to prosecute those persons who violate such laws; and	Be it finally RESOLVED, That we call upon Southern Baptists to redouble their efforts in their own communities to reach across racial and ethnical boundaries to establish both wholesome friendships and mutually beneficial ministry relationships.",1993

"	WHEREAS, The Bible clearly teaches that human life is sacred and must be protected; and 	WHEREAS, Southern Baptists have consistently upheld the sanctity of human life by adopting numerous resolutions at the associational, state, and national venues, advocating public policies to protect the unborn and encouraging the development of crisis pregnancy centers; and 	WHEREAS, RU 486, the French abortion pill, is a direct assault on the sacredness and value of unborn human life in that this drug kills an unborn child whose heart has already started to beat; and	WHEREAS, While RU 486 has often been called a ""morning-after"" pill, its only proven use is an abortifacient and is, therefore, not a true contraceptive; and	WHEREAS, President Clinton signed on Executive Order on January 22, 1993 (the 20th anniversary of the Roe v.

Therefore, Be it RESOLVED, That we, the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Orlando, Florida, June 14-16, 1994, oppose educational reform experiments including those labeled ""Outcome-Based Education,"" which risks the undermining of Judeo-Christian values, local control, and traditional academic standards of excellence; and	Be if further RESOLVED, That we commend those educators who have maintained a faithful witness for biblical morality in our public schools and that we reaffirm our conviction that parents have the right and duty to educate their children and that government policies should support, rather than undermine this right; and	Be it finally RESOLVED, That we urge Southern Baptists to be actively involved in the education of their children, whether in public or private schooling, and to be involved with their state and local public school boards in order to influence the formulation of educational objectives and to insist that educational reform does not abandon traditional academic standards or community values in local schools.",1994
"WHEREAS, Southern Baptists historically have supported religious freedom and its related political ideal of a ""free church in a free state,"" as embodied in the First Amendment; and	WHEREAS, We affirm that the principle of the separation of church and state applies to the workplace in the sense that employers and employees should be free from governmental interference or coercion as they freely express matters of biblical truth and faith; and	WHEREAS, The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is the enforcing agency for federal civil rights law prohibiting employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, or disability, and has the authority to issue guidelines to help employers understand and comply with various statutes and court decisions; and	WHEREAS, The EEOC has proposed, but has not yet formally adopted, certain ""Guidelines on Harassment"" which would apply a consolidated set of rules to all charges of workplace harassment, whether the subject matter involves race, gender, religion, or some other protected group; and	WHEREAS, The definition of harassment in the proposed guidelines is so vague and ambiguous as to be extended to various forms of religious expression which someone may claim to create a ""hostile or offensive environment""; and	WHEREAS, Many Southern Baptists, while deploring religious harassment in the workplace, nonetheless oppose these consolidated, ""one-size-fits-all"" harassment guidelines, because of the ""chilling effect"" they will have upon free religious expression in the workplace; and	WHEREAS, If the subject of religion were to remain in the proposed guidelines, religious liberty advocates and employment lawyers predict that many employers will try to avoid lawsuits by adopting company policies which severely restrict freedom of religious expression among employees in the workplace; and	WHEREAS, Many Southern Baptists find it offensive that religion would be relegated to the same, consolidated guidelines which are applied to allegations of racist slurs and sexual vulgarity; and	WHEREAS, Religion is constitutionally and statutorily different from all other groups covered by the proposed guidelines, which uniqueness demands distinctive treatment in separate guidelines.	THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That we, the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention, meeting in Orlando, Florida, June 14-16, 1994, express our concern that the consolidated ""Guidelines on Harassment"" proposed by the EEOC, as currently written, pose a grave risk to religious freedom in the workplace; and	BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED, That the Christian Life Commission be encouraged to work vigorously with the appropriate government officials to see that religion is deleted from the proposed guidelines and that the subject of religious harassment should be addressed separately in the guidelines on religious discrimination.",1994
"WHEREAS, Health care reform legislation is a major agenda item for the President and Congress this year; and	WHEREAS, As our Creator is actively concerned and involved in all of life, we, as His disciples, are morally obligated to speak to this value-laden issue; and	WHEREAS, Christians historically have been at the forefront in providing compassionate health care ministry, including Southern Baptists who have demonstrated our concern for health care through the establishment of charitable hospitals and clinics; and	WHEREAS, In addition to the President's ""Health Security Act,"" numerous other proposals and options for health care reform are under serious consideration in Congress; and	WHEREAS, While most Americans enjoy a health care system which is the envy of the world, millions of Americans are uninsured or underinsured due to long-term unemployment, temporary unemployment, or health conditions which prevent insurance coverage; and	WHEREAS, There is a need for revision in the health care delivery system in order to provide affordable care for all those in need; and	WHEREAS, Escalating costs, out-of-control malpractice lawsuits, the millions of uninsured, and lack of ""portability"" of insurance coverage constitute important problems with health care in America; and	WHEREAS, The President's bill and some alternatives explicitly provide for morally objectionable provisions, such as:	o	abortion on demand or the absence of language which explicitly excludes abortion coverage,	o	distribution of contraceptives to minors without parental consent through public schools by the establishment of school-based health clinics,	o	the rationing of health care on the basis of economic decisions rather than the provision of health care on the basis of medical need,	o	the violation of the centuries-old, covenantal relationship between physician and patient,	o	inadequate conscience clauses which fail to protect religious persons, institutions, organizations, and medical facilities from participating in a health care system which would condone and support morally objectionable practices, and	o	the forced inclusion of Southern Baptist institutions and churches in reform plans which may undermine the missions activities of our denomination.	THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That while our Baptist heritage of insistence on limited government causes us to believe the need for reform does not mandate a government-controlled, health care system, we, the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Orlando, Florida, June 14-16, 1994, nevertheless encourage the President and Congress in their attempt to reform America's health care system; and	BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED, That we oppose any health care reform legislation that includes any of the aforementioned morally objectionable provisions.",1994

Therefore, Be it RESOLVED, That we, the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Orlando, Florida, June 14-16, 1994, commend the Report of the Presidential Theological Study Committee to the institutions and agencies of the Southern Baptist Convention as a guide to enable them to bear a faithful gospel witness to a culture in disarray, to be salt and light in a society that has lost its moral compass, and to serve as a resource for a new denominational consensus rooted in theological substance and doctrinal fidelity.

"WHEREAS, Certain Roman Catholic and Evangelical leaders in the United States of America have recently issued an unofficial document ""Evangelicals and Catholics Together,"" calling for a recognition of issues of both agreement and disagreement, and a commitment to work toward greater understanding; and	WHEREAS, Many Roman Catholics and Southern Baptists have found in recent years a common area of agreement in their concern for the sanctity of human life, their opposition to the spread of pornography in our society, their commitment to traditional family values, their concern for securing the rights of all individuals without respect to differences of religion, race, gender, and class, and many other areas of moral concern; and	WHEREAS, Southern Baptists have historically confessed with all true Christians everywhere belief in the Triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the full deity and perfect humanity of Jesus Christ, His virgin birth, His sinless life, His substitutionary atonement for sins, His resurrection from the dead, His exaltation to the right hand of God, and His triumphal return, and we recognize that born again believers in the Lord Jesus Christ may be found in all Christian denominations; and	WHEREAS, Baptists have historically differed from Roman Catholics on such matters as:  the nature and means of salvation, the character and function of the church, the role and interpretation of baptism and the Lord's Supper, devotion to the Virgin Mary, the veneration of the Saints, papal infallibility, the structure of church government, and the relation of Scripture and tradition as sources of spiritual and teaching authority for belief and practice; and	WHEREAS, Southern Baptists are strongly committed to world evangelization and are commanded by Christ in His Great Commission to share the Gospel with every nation, nationality, people group, and person; and	WHEREAS, The Foreign Mission Board trustees on April 27, 1994, by unanimous resolution, expressed concern that the Evangelical-Catholic document is subject to interpretations harmful to Southern Baptist work of global witness and missionary outreach.	Therefore Be it RESOLVED, That the 137th annual session of the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Orlando, Florida, June 14-16, 1994, affirms the benefit of conversation with any religious group, which is willing objectively and openly to discuss their faith, and to examine it on the basis of Holy Scripture, and on such basis we encourage the Interfaith Witness Department of the Home Mission Board to pursue on-going Southern Baptist-Roman Catholic conversation while maintaining our Southern Baptist confession without compromise; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That due to the degeneration of moral values and ethical norms, coupled with the loss of meaning in people's lives and the relative status ascribed to historic truth claims in our contemporary world, we call for endeavors to bring about cooperative efforts on the part of all Christian organizations to present united support for pressing social and moral concerns; and we call on all religious bodies to affirm the importance of religious liberty and all of its expressions including the freedom to evangelize among all peoples everywhere; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That we confess the historic Baptist doctrine of justification, namely, that the righteousness of Christ is imputed to us by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone without any addition of good works or human efforts; and we affirm that justification by faith alone is an essential of the Christian message, and we deny any view of salvation that adds to or subtracts from the sole sufficiency of Jesus Christ as Redeemer and Lord; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That the Bible is the inspired and inerrant Word of God and is the infallible touchstone by which all other authorities, teachers, and traditions must be judged; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That the Southern Baptist Convention affirm its commitment to evangelism and missionary witness among populations and individuals not characterized by genuine faith in Christ alone, and we reject any suggestion that such witness be characterized as ""sheep stealing"" proselytizing or a wasteful use of resources; and	Be it finally RESOLVED, That Southern Baptists reaffirm their commitment to evangelism and global missions and renew their intent to share Christ with all people everywhere to the end that the unsaved may be converted and the unchurched may become a part of Bible-teaching, Christ-honoring congregations.",1994

"WHEREAS, President Bill Clinton has nominated Dr. Henry Foster to be Surgeon General of the United States; and	WHEREAS, The previous Surgeon General was highly controversial due to her strong advocacy of abortion on demand, deviant sexuality and especially harmful premarital sexuality; and	WHEREAS, Dr. Foster holds similarly controversial ethical and policy positions including:	--absolute abortion on demand, including opposition to parental involvement legislation as exemplified by his role as a Public Policy Advocate for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America	--personal performance of abortions	--advocacy of the failed safe sex approach to sex education for young people including the distribution of condoms and contraceptives to minors without parental consent as demonstrated in his I Have A Future program	--sterilization of mentally impaired women in the 1970s; and	WHEREAS, Though he holds impressive academic and professional credentials, Dr. Fosters credibility has come into question because of the changing accounts of the number of abortions he has performed, the initial failure to disclose his long-time association with Planned Parenthood Federation of America the leading abortion provider in America, and the questions about when he became aware of the infamous experiments on black men with syphilis at Tuskegee; and	WHEREAS, As an official of the United States government who is a spokesperson on public health issues the Surgeon General has a prominent platform with which he or she can be an advocate of public policies.

"WHEREAS, Since 1989 the United States government has been funding with tax dollars the massive development of genetic technology - the Human Genome Project - through the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy; and	WHEREAS, Genetic technology holds both the wonderful potential for the treatment and cure of as many as 4,000 genetically-linked illnesses and the hideous potential of increasing the number of abortions through prenatal genetic screening, cultivating a eugenic mind-set in the American public, and serving as the basis for patents for animal and human genes; and	WHEREAS, In 1980 the United States Supreme Court ruled, in a 5 to 4 decision in Diamond v. Chakrabarty, that the United States Patent Office could issue a patent on a genetically-modified living organism; and	WHEREAS, Since that time patents have been issued for genetically-altered animals, such as a mouse with cancer genes and all its progeny; and	WHEREAS, Patenting genetically-altered animals essentially confers ownership of an animal type, e.g., all mice with the cancer gene; and	WHEREAS, Efforts continue to be made to patent both animal genes and human tissues and gene sequences; and	WHEREAS, Patents grant sole proprietary rights (ownership) for seventeen years to the holder; and	WHEREAS, The scriptures of both the Old and New Testaments plainly teach that God alone is creator and owner of all he has made (Genesis 1:1; Colossians 1:15-16); and	WHEREAS, Humans are given the mandate to be stewards of the earth and of animal life, not usurpers of Gods prerogatives and not co-creators (Genesis 1:28); and	WHEREAS, Human legitimately may own individual or groups of animals of a given species, but not an entire species and its progeny; and	WHEREAS, Human life is uniquely made in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:27); and	WHEREAS, Leaders from virtually every major religion in the United States held a press conference on May 18, 1995, decrying the patenting of animal and human tissues and genetic sequences.

"WHEREAS, The 104th Congress is considering an amendment to the Constitution to protect the freedom of private persons, including students in public schools, to engage in voluntary prayer and other religious expression in circumstances in which expression of a non-religious character would be permitted; and to prohibit the denial of benefits or other discrimination against persons on account of the religious character of their speech or status; and	WHEREAS, Although specific language has not been selected, some proposals would also stop lawsuits challenging government accommodation of public or ceremonial acknowledgements of the religious heritage, beliefs and traditions of its people, such as the motto In God We Trust on coinage, or the display of the Ten Commandments in public buidings; and	WHEREAS, The biblical principle of religious liberty is rooted in the nature of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the nature of the human spirit as created by God:  spiritual regeneration and reformation can and should occur only as an individual freely responds by faith to Gods work and Gods Word, and not in response to coercion by any person, government or church; and	WHEREAS, The constitutional principle of religious liberty is rooted in the convictions of Baptist forebears like John Leland and other early Americans who, despite arguments that no amendment was necessary, insisted upon certain amendments to the Constitution, resulting in the First Amendment Religion Clauses:  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; and	WHEREAS, With growing frequency the Supreme Court has issued confusing and contradictory rulings which have led some lower courts and public officials to interpret the Establishment Clause as prohibiting what the Free Exercise Clause should protect, and to interpret the Free Speech clause as prohibiting discrimination or censorship based on the content of speech, with the exception that religious speech on government-owned property or at government-sponsored meetings must be treated discriminatorily in the name of strict separation of church and state; and	WHEREAS, After decades of hoping that legal briefs, statutory remedies, or changes in court personnel could reverse the rising tide of discrimination against religious expression in the schoolhouse, workplace and public square, it is time for the American people to express their will clearly through the Constitutional amendment process which provides the surest way to stop such discrimination.	Therefore, be it RESOLVED, That we, the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention, meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, June 20-22, 1995, call on Congress to adopt and send to the states for ratification a constitutional amendment to protect the freedom of private persons, including students in public schools, to engage in voluntary prayer and other religious expression in circumstances in which expression of a non-religious character would be permitted; and to prohibit the denial of benefits or other discrimination against persons on account of the religious character of their speech or status; and to permit government accommodation of public or ceremonial acknowledgements of religious heritage, beliefs and traditions of its people; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That we call on the Southern Baptist Christian Life Commission to work for passage of such an amendment, while also advocating Baptist principles of freedom of conscience, to prevent government from composing, compelling or subsidizing prayer or religious expression by any person; and	Be it finally RESOLVED, That on this 150th Anniversary of the Southern Baptist Convention, we reaffirm the principle and pledge ourselves to the practice of our God-given right of religious liberty, in order to obey Gods commands to pray without ceasing and to present the Gospel of Jesus Christ to everyone, everywhere.",1995

Therefore, be it RESOLVED, By the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, June 20-22, 1995, that the Southern Baptist Convention express its support for all peoples suffering denial of religious liberty, but especially for those who are of the household of faith, and even more particularly for those who share Baptist convictions and commitments; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That the messengers reaffirm their Baptist heritage in supporting the right of freedom of conscience in religious concerns and the right to convert or change ones religion not due to coercion but due to alteration of conscience and conviction; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That the Southern Baptist Convention call upon its members to pray for those persecuted for their faith, to support them by alerting governments, political leaders and others in charge over us in the realm of secular governments of the concerns of the people of faith when such rights are denied; and	Be it finally RESOLVED, That the Christian Life Commission in concert with the Foreign Mission Board, Interfaith Witness Department of the Home Mission Board, and the Baptist World Alliance, be encouraged to continue to investigate such abuses and their causes as well as to inform our people and churches of such abuses and concerns, as well as to seek ways to represent even more effectively the concerns of this Convention to various government, diplomatic, and religious leaders at home and abroad to the greater end that the gospel may have freer course at home and abroad and that the people of the earth may know the goodness and love of God through the saving and atoning life and death and glorious resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.",1995
"	WHEREAS, The Southern Baptist Convention has consistently and overwhelmingly adopted resolutions affirming the declarations of Scripture that all human life is a sacred gift from our sovereign God and therefore that all abortions, except in those very rare cases where the life of the mother is clearly in danger, are wrong; and 	WHEREAS, A specific technique known as partial-birth abortion is a particularly grisly procedure wherein a doctor uses forceps and hands to deliver an intact baby, feet first, until only the head remains in the birth canal, whereafter the doctor pierces the base of the baby’s skull with surgical scissors, whereafter he or she then inserts a canula into the incision and suctions out the brain of the baby so the head collapses; and	WHEREAS, The Congress of the United States has passed legislation which would make this inhumane procedure, which the American Catholic cardinals have correctly characterized as More akin to infanticide than abortion illegal except to save the life of the mother; and	WHEREAS, The President of the United States vetoed this legislation and offered as justification for his action that he had prayed about the matter and determined that he could not sign the legislation unless it contained an exception for cases where there might be Serious health consequences to the mother and	WHEREAS, The mother’s health exception has been completely discredited as a catch-all loophole which has been demonstrated to include any reason the mother so desires; and	WHEREAS, The Bible is the perfect revelation of God’s will, including His perfect moral will for those whom He has created in His very own image; and	WHEREAS, It is impossible to conclude that God, who is perfect and unchanging in all His attributes, and whose laws are perfect and immutable, would reveal to any person, through prayer, that which is contrary to His Word; and	WHEREAS, Abortion in general, and partial-birth abortion in particular, continues as a blight upon our culture and surely deserves God’s judgment; Now, therefore,	BE IT RESOLVED, That we, the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention, meeting in session June 11-13, 1996, in New Orleans, Louisiana, do commend those members of Congress who voted to support legislation which would have abolished partial-birth abortions; and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we express our strong disapproval of the votes of those members of Congress who stood in opposition to this legislation; and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we express our strong disapproval of President Clinton’s veto of this legislation; and 	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we express our disapproval of the President’s suggestion that God would reveal to him in prayer that any abortion method, particularly one so barbarous in technique and so cruel in effect, would ever have God’s approval; and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we, the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention, in a genuine spirit of love do admonish and encourage President Clinton, himself a Southern Baptist, to reverse his shameful decision to veto this legislation and sign it into law; or in the alternative of such failure to reverse his action, we call upon every member of Congress to vote to override the President’s veto; and	BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED, That we pray for our nation, upon whom the blight of abortion remains, that we might come to recognize the sanctity of innocent, unborn babies and that we might seek civil justice for these innocent victims of a cruelty so harsh that we are surely accountable for our failure to intervene on their behalf.",1996

"WHEREAS, The Southern Baptist Convention has frequently stated its opposition to the gambling industry and the devastating effects of gambling upon the moral and economic life of our nation; and	WHEREAS, No national commission has studied the effects of gambling upon society since 1976; and	WHEREAS, Participation in gambling has grown at an alarming rate since 1976, when Americans legally wagered 17 billion, in 1994, when Americans legally wagered 480 billion; and	WHEREAS, Legislation has been passed in the United States House of Representatives of the 104th Congress which would establish a commission to study the impact of gambling upon society and to make such recommendations as may be necessary to correct those problems which the study may reveal; and	WHEREAS, There is pending in the United State Senate of the Congress, legislation similar to that already passed in the House; and	WHEREAS, If Congress passes such legislation it will then be forwarded to the President of the United States for consideration; and	WHEREAS, As it is currently proposed, this legislation provides that the commission would be made up of individuals appointed by the President of the United States, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and the Majority Leader of the United States Senate; and	WHEREAS, The gambling industry is unashamed in its relentless pursuit of political advantage by monetary means; Now, therefore,	BE IT RESOLVED, That we support legislation which seeks to evaluate the effect of public policy with regard to gambling, and the impact of gambling upon society; and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we commend those members of the United States House of Representatives who voted in favor of H.R. 497, known as the National Gambling Impact and Policy Commission Act, and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we urge the United States Senate to pass legislation to the same effect; and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we urge the President of the United States to sign any such legislation which is substantially similar to that already approved by the United States House of Representatives; and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we urge those responsible for appointing members to the Commission to exercise their judgment with caution and to avoid appointing individuals whose primary interest in the outcome of the Commission may be motivated by protection of the pecuniary interests of the gambling industry; and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we urge members of Congress to be undeterred in their efforts by representatives of the lucrative gambling industry who unashamedly seek to exert their influence in the political process with the proceeds of their nefarious profits.

"WHEREAS, In May 1993, the Hawaiian Supreme Court ruled that the state’s exclusion of same-sex couples from marital status may be contrary to the Hawaiian state constitution because it amounts to invidious discrimination; and 	WHEREAS, The Hawaiian Supreme Court has instructed the state of Hawaii to prove compelling state interests for limiting marriage to heterosexual couples; and	WHEREAS,  The instructions of the Hawaiian Supreme Court shift the burden of proof from persons seeking to change existing law and places it instead on officers of the government who support norms of conduct long established in the Western legal tradition; and	WHEREAS, The compelling state interests standard is extraordinarily difficult to prove before a court already disposed to regard the exclusion of same-sex relationships from the definition of marriage as a matter of invidious discrimination, and therefore the state of Hawaii is soon likely to grant full legal status to the marriage of homosexual couples; and	WHEREAS, Under the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution of the United States, any marriage performed in the state of Hawaii will, apart from the enactment of state-by-state exceptions or the enactment of a new and comprehensive federal law, have to be legally recognized in every other state; and	WHEREAS, Homosexual couples from every other state are preparing to obtain marriage licenses in Hawaii and then to challenge the courts, legislatures and institutions in their home states to treat their same-sex relationship as having identical status to the recognition of marriage between a man and a woman; and	WHEREAS, Challenging the exclusion of homosexual couples from the definition of marriage as sanctioned and protected by civil law is a strategy to appropriate the moral capital of marriage in order to enforce acceptance of homosexual conduct and homosexual desires in the public arenas of American life; and	WHEREAS, There is much scientific evidence showing that homosexual attractions are pathological, abnormal, and mostly if not entirely a matter of external influence, learned behavior, acquired taste and personal choice; and, although there have been speculations, no conclusive scientific evidence has been found to support claims that homosexual attractions are biologically fixed and irreversible; and 	WHEREAS, Even should a biological link with homosexuality be discovered, it could not settle the morality of homosexual behavior, and could not serve to justify, much less require, any society to grant the status of marriage to homosexual couples; andWHEREAS, God, who is both Moral Ruler of the Universe and the Creator of all that is, and who knows and understands the physical and psychological composition of all and every human life better than any human scientist will ever know it, has stated in Scripture that homosexual conduct is always a gross abomination for all human beings, both men and women, in all circumstances, without exception (Lev. 18:22 and 20:13); and	WHEREAS, God makes it clear in Scripture that even desire to engage in a homosexual sexual relationship is always sinful, impure, degrading, shameful, unnatural, indecent and perverted (Rom. 1:24-27), so any effort to extend the meaning of marriage in order to sanction the satisfaction of such desire must also be in every case sinful, impure, degrading, shameful, unnatural, indecent and perverted; and	WHEREAS, God by saying their blood will be on their own heads (Lev.20:13) has explicitly ruled out any effort by homosexual couples to justify their behavior, or to claim their homosexual relationship deserves protected legal status, by shifting blame or responsibility for their same-sex relationship to the Creator who made them; and 	WHEREAS, Marriage is God’s idea established in the order of creation to be a permanent union of one man with one woman (Gen. 1:28, and 2:24), and marriage is therefore first and foremost a divine institution (Mat. 19:6) and only secondarily a cultural and civil institution; and	WHEREAS, Jesus reaffirmed the origin of marriage in the order of creation and declared marriage to be a sacred, monogamous and life-long institution joining one man with one woman (Matt. 19:4-6); and	WHEREAS, Any action by the government giving homosexual unions the legal status of marriage denies the fundamental immorality of homosexual behavior and causes the government of any nation so doing to jeopardize seriously the favor of Almighty God on whom the security, welfare and stability of every nation, even Gentile nations (Lev. 18:24-25, 28; Ps. 2; Am. 1:3,6, 9, 11, 13; Isa. 13-21), ultimately depends; and	WHEREAS, Separating marriage from the complementary union of male and female trivializes the concept of marriage in the laws, public policies, educational systems, and other institutions of society; and	WHEREAS, Only the marriage of male and female serves to tame the impulses of self-centered individuals by inter-generational obligations and commitments; and	WHEREAS, Failure in the courts and institutions of civil law to recognize the unique importance of heterosexual family units, by granting moral equivalence to the idea of same-sex relationships, will surely and very seriously undercut the formation of stable heterosexual family units in future generations; and	WHEREAS, The future of the United States of America will be placed at risk because no society can survive that does not recognize, protect, defend the unique importance of heterosexual marriage to its own health and stability; and	WHEREAS, The legal recognition of homosexual marriage carries the potential use of force, a force that will likely be turned against those who do not or cannot accept the moral equivalence of homosexual marriages; and	WHEREAS, The enforcement of marriage laws, standards of educational instruction in schools, and the regulation of fair business practices will be adjusted to require public recognition of homosexual marriages, and this adjustment will certainly undermine, and may even restrain, the public communication, influence, and independence of individuals, groups and institutions who believe and teach that homosexual marriage is immoral in both concept and practice; and	WHEREAS, Legalizing homosexual marriage will force public schools to teach the acceptability of homosexual marriage and will likely lead to laws requiring that businesses remove distinctions between homosexual and heterosexual relationships in the way they treat marriage benefit for their employees; and	WHEREAS, Legalizing homosexual marriage raises the specter of new laws and policies intended to marginalize, privatize, or silence the social and moral influence of parents and churches which teach that homosexual marriage is wrong or that heterosexual marriage is morally superior; Now, therefore,	BE IT RESOLVED, That we, the messengers of the one hundred thirty-ninth meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention, assembled in New Orleans, Louisiana, June 11-13, 1996, do clearly and steadfastly oppose the legalization of homosexual marriage by the state of Hawaii, or by any other state, or by the United States of America; and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we affirm the Bible’s teaching that promotion of homosexual conduct and relationships by any society, including action by the governments to sanction and legitimize homosexual relationships by the legalization of homosexual marriages, is an abominable sin calling for God’s swift judgment upon any such society (Lev. 18:22, 28; Isa. 3:9); and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we commit ourselves to pray faithfully against the legalization of homosexual marriages in American law, and to preach and teach the truth concerning what the Bible says about homosexuality, homosexual conduct and the institution of marriage, and against the foolishness, danger and moral wickedness of any government action to accept, sanction, approve, protect, or promote homosexual marriage; and	BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That we commit ourselves to pray for, affirm, and support legislative and legal efforts and all persons involved in efforts to oppose the legalization of homosexual marriages through judicial actions, through public policy decisions and through legislation introduced at both the state and federal levels of government; and we call upon all judges, all persons in public office, and all candidates for public office, to do all they can to resist and oppose the legalization of homosexual marriages; and	BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED, That because any law, or any policy or regulation supporting a law, that legalizes homosexual marriage is and must be completely and thoroughly wicked according to God’s standards revealed in the Bible, we do most solemnly pledge our decision never to recognize the moral legitimacy of any such law, policy or regulation, and we affirm that, whatever the stakes (Dan. 3:17-18), we will never conform to or obey (Acts 4:19) anything required by any governing body to implement, impose or act upon any such law.  So help us God.",1996

Ephesians 5:25; 1 Peter 3:70, and likewise has set the gender-based role and responsibility of females to be that of help and nurture (Genesis 2:18) and life-giving (Genesis 3:20) under male leadership and protection (cf. 1 Peter 3:7); and	WHEREAS, The purpose of military combat is to inflict deadly harm upon an enemy, and the essence of combat is to use force against an enemy in order to kill, damage or destroy—a purpose and essence aligned with the male role but opposed to the female role; and	WHEREAS, The moral justification for combat service is the duty to protect and defend vital national interests, including the welfare, security, and good order of families, which justification is essentially linked to the divinely assigned role and responsibilities of self-sacrificial male headship of the family (Ephesians 5:23-24); and	WHEREAS,  The pattern established by God throughout the Bible is that men, not women, bear responsibility to serve in combat if war is necessary (Genesis 14:14; Numbers 31:3, 21, 49; Deuteronomy 20:5-9; 3:14; Joshua 1:14-18; 6:3, 7, 9; 8:3; 10:7; 1 Samuel 16:18; 18:5; 2 Samuel 11:1; 17:8; 23:8-39; Psalm 45:3-5; Song of Solomon 3:7-8; Isaiah 42:13); and	WHEREAS, Biblical examples that record women serving in combat (Judges 4:4-23) are presented as contrary to proper and normal gender-based distinctions, and result from a shameful failure of male leadership (Judges 4:9-10; Nahum 3:13); andWHEREAS, Willful rejection of a gender-based role distinction that limits combat military service to males is a foolish social experiment that:  (1) threatens good military order and discipline by unnecessarily escalating sexual tensions among combat warriors, (2) weakens unit cohesion, (3) exposes female warriors taken as P.O.W.s to the special trauma of rape and sexual abuse, (4) places a major new strain on marital fidelity, and (5) risks the nation’s military security by scrambling the moral framework defining male/female relationships.	Therefore, be it RESOLVED, That the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention, meeting June 9-11, 1998, in Salt Lake City, Utah, do, with loyal respect and deep concern, warn against and oppose the training and assigning of females to military combat service because:  it rejects gender-based distinctions established by God in the order of creation; it undermines male headship in the family by failing to recognize the unique gender-based responsibility of men to protect women and children; and it subordinates the combat readiness of American troops, and the national security of the United States, to the unbiblical social agenda of ideological feminism; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That we give deepest gratitude and honor to those courageous women who have served their country in military support roles; and	Be it further RESOLVED, That we commit our prayer support to all military members and families serving this great nation around the world.	Be it finally RESOLVED, That we call upon the President, Congress, and all military leaders to reverse the present policy and to restore the historic limitation of military combat service to males only.",1998

"WHEREAS, The Bible teaches that all human life is sacred (Genesis 1:26-27); andWHEREAS, Humans have a sacred trust to care for the most vulnerable among us (Matthew 25:31-46); andWHEREAS, Current trends in stem cell research promise great benefit to some and threaten great peril to others; andWHEREAS, Stem cell research using non-embryonic stem cells offers tremendous hope for millions of people and has already produced many successful results in humans, such as relieving the symptoms of juvenile diabetes, reversing Parkinson’s disease symptoms, regenerating heart tissue, and restoring feeling and mobility to people with spinal cord injuries; andWHEREAS, Embryonic stem cell research currently requires the destruction of human embryos; andWHEREAS, Embryo-destructive research has not produced any positive results or cures; andWHEREAS, Even if it does, it is never morally acceptable to prey on some humans to benefit others; andWHEREAS, We do not believe that the issue of world competition in embryo-destructive research justifies our nation’s entry into this barbaric activity; andWHEREAS, The United States House of Representatives has voted to provide federal funding for human-destructive research on embryos being stored at fertility clinics; andWHEREAS, The United States Senate is preparing to vote on this issue; now, therefore, be itRESOLVED, That the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Nashville, Tennessee, June 21-22, 2005, wholeheartedly support efforts to find cures and therapies for human maladies that respect the sanctity of all human life; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we strongly support stem cell research that does not require the destruction of human embryos or put them at risk in obtaining human stem cells; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we deplore embryo-destructive research, since it kills human beings in their earliest stages of development; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we express our deep disappointment in those members of the United States House of Representatives who voted in favor of embryo-destructive research for their abject failure to protect the lives of these innocent human beings; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we commend those members of the United States House of Representatives who voted against embryo-destructive research for their courageous stand on behalf of these voiceless human beings; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we urge the United States Senate to reject any legislation that calls for embryo-destructive research, regardless of the origin of the embryos, beyond the cell lines which are currently approved for federally funded research; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we commend the president for his commitment to veto any bills that call for federal funding of embryo-destructive research beyond the cell lines he has already approved; and be it finallyRESOLVED, That we encourage Southern Baptists to consider ways they can become involved in life-affirming activities, including adopting embryos being stored at fertility clinics.",2005
"WHEREAS, Some federal judges have undermined and supplanted the United States system of limited government by presuming to write and impose new laws upon America’s citizenry rather than interpreting law according to constitutional intent; andWHEREAS, This tendency by some unelected judges to legislate from the bench subverts the foundation of our democracy, “a government of the people, by the people, and for the people,” and moves the nation closer to being governed by an elite class, unaccountable to the American people; andWHEREAS, Some of the worst decisions put into law during the last half century have been handed down by federal judges who hold no valid constitutional or legislated authority to make such decrees; andWHEREAS, Examples of this judicial activism include, but are not limited to, the United States Supreme Court’s approval of abortion on demand in Roe v. Wade (1973) and its declaration that a popularly held moral disapproval of homosexual sodomy was insufficient grounds for laws prohibiting that behavior in Lawrence v. Texas (2003); andWHEREAS, Judges increasingly invoke foreign courts and foreign law as partial justification for their opinions, e.g., Atkins v. Virginia (2002); Lawrence v. Texas (2003); Goodridge v. Massachusetts (2003); and, most recently, Roper v. Simmons (2005); andWHEREAS, In recent years the president has appointed judges he believes are strict constructionists, who would interpret the Constitution rather than make law; andWHEREAS, The Constitution is clear regarding the nomination and confirmation process: “He (the president) shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court and all other Officers of the United States” (U.S. Constitution, art. 2, sec. 2); andWHEREAS, Many United States senators have recently defaulted on their explicit constitutional responsibility to vote as a body to confirm or deny the president’s appointees to various positions in the federal court system by filibustering the confirmation of some of the president’s judicial nominees or by engaging in other acts of obstruction; andWHEREAS, These obstructionist activities have disproportionately targeted nominees who hold biblical convictions on issues such as the sanctity of life and the definition of marriage; andWHEREAS, This dereliction of duty constitutes a deplorable and intolerable impediment to good government; andWHEREAS, It is likely that the president will have the opportunity to appoint one or more Supreme Court justices during the remainder of his term, setting off an intense battle unless fairness is restored to the judicial confirmation process; now, therefore, be itRESOLVED, That the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Nashville, Tennessee, June 21-22, 2005, call on the United States Senate to return to the constitutionally established principle and two-hundred-year-old practice of basing “advice and consent” decisions on a simple majority vote of the Senate; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we call upon all future presidents to nominate strict constructionist judges who will interpret rather than make law; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we call upon Southern Baptists and all members of the Body of Christ to provide their United States senators with verbal and written encouragement to stop the obstruction of judicial nominees; and be it finallyRESOLVED, That we commend Tennessee Senator Bill Frist for courageously standing in the gap in his position as Senate majority leader, defending the appointment of fair and impartial judges to the federal bench and insisting upon their right to a vote of confirmation by the full Senate.",2005

"WHEREAS, The U.S. House of Representatives has passed the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007, H.R. 1592, and a similar bill has been introduced in the U.S. Senate; andWHEREAS, These bills create special protected classes of homosexual and transgendered persons; andWHEREAS, The Bible is clear in its denunciation of homosexual behavior (Leviticus 18:22; Romans 1:21-28; 1 Corinthians 6:9), and upon that basis, our Founding Fathers and early laws opposed its practice in American society; andWHEREAS, Proponents argue that the establishment of such protected classes is a civil rights issue, yet neither homosexuals nor transgendered persons constitute a class like race, ethnicity, or gender because their identity is based upon a lifestyle choice; and WHEREAS, Such hate crimes legislation violates the U.S. Constitution’s Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law by extending special protected status to certain groups of people that is not available for others; andWHEREAS, Such hate crimes legislation criminalizes beliefs as well as actions, creating a form of thought crime; andWHEREAS, In many jurisdictions where such thought crimes laws have been passed, they have been used to actively punish Christians who peacefully voice their moral opposition to homosexual conduct; andWHEREAS, Harry Hammond, an evangelical Christian in Britain, was arrested for holding a sign protesting homosexuality, and Britain’s High Court ruled in 2004 that he was “properly convicted” of a criminal offense, despite the fact that he was demonstrating peacefully and was assaulted by homosexual onlookers enraged by his sign; andWHEREAS, Hugh Owens of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, was found guilty in 2001 of “inciting hatred” by the Human Rights Commission and ordered to pay C$1,500 to three homosexual activists for publishing an advertisement quoting Bible verses about homosexuality; and WHEREAS, Pastor Ake Green of Borgholm, Sweden, was sentenced to a month in jail in 2003 for “inciting hatred” based on that nation’s hate crimes laws when he preached a grace- and truth-filled message concerning homosexuality, comparing the sins of Sweden to the sins of Sodom; andWHEREAS, Eleven Christians in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, were physically accosted by homosexual demonstrators in 2004 and yet were themselves arrested on felony counts based on hate crimes laws for lawfully and peacefully protesting and sharing the Gospel at a “gay pride” event; andWHEREAS, Many Christian leaders and pro-family groups are alarmed at the prospect of a law in which a person’s thoughts or opinions alone—particularly disapproval of homosexual behavior—would lead to federal prosecution; andWHEREAS, The inevitable application of this legislation would abridge our First Amendment freedom of speech and thus criminalize biblical preaching and speaking truth about homosexuality, achieving a key goal of homosexual activists and their allies, which is to muzzle the church in its moral opposition to their sinful lifestyle; now, therefore, be itRESOLVED, That the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in San Antonio, Texas, June 12-13, 2007, express profound disappointment in the members of the U.S. House who passed the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007; and be it further RESOLVED, That we strongly urge the members of the U.S. Senate to reject this and any other bill that creates a special protected status for certain groups, violating the U.S. Constitution’s Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That if Congress passes this hate crimes bill, or any similar bill, we strongly encourage the president to veto such unconstitutional legislation because it undermines the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection guarantee, and its application poses a direct threat to the First Amendment freedom of speech of those morally opposed to homosexuality; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we urge all Americans to avoid acts of hatred and violence toward homosexuals and transgendered people, but to instead treat our fellow citizens with the kind of civility we would prefer to receive ourselves (Matthew 7:12); and be it finallyRESOLVED, That we encourage all believers to love and show compassion toward homosexuals and transgendered persons, sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ, who is able to bring true freedom from error and to set free the captives of sin (John 8:34-36).",2007
"WHEREAS, God is not a distant bystander with respect to human affairs, but judges all people and holds them accountable for their thoughts and actions (Psalm 24:1; Isaiah 45:5-8; Hebrews 4:12-13); andWHEREAS, Christians are called by God to exercise caring stewardship and dominion over the earth and environment (Genesis 1:28; Psalm 8); andWHEREAS, We share God’s concern that the poor should not be abused, taken advantage of, nor overburdened (Psalm 140:12; Proverbs 14:31; 29:7; Isaiah 25:4; Ezekiel 22:29, 31; Matthew 25:40; John 14:15); andWHEREAS, The record shows that global temperature has risen and fallen cyclically throughout geologic history, with some periods warmer and others cooler than the present; andWHEREAS, The global temperature has generally risen since 1850 as it recovers from the “Little Ice Age” (1550-1850 A.D.); andWHEREAS, The ten warmest years since 1850 have occurred in the last fifteen years; andWHEREAS, The scientific community is divided regarding the extent to which humans are responsible for recent global warming; andWHEREAS, Many scientists reject the idea of catastrophic human-induced global warming; andWHEREAS, Sixty international experts in climate and related sciences signed an open letter on April 6, 2006, to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper stating that scientific evidence does not support the computer models of catastrophic human-induced global warming; andWHEREAS, The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), while remaining politically active in warning of catastrophic human-induced global warming, has recently altered many of its previous statements, reducing its projections of the magnitude of global warming and its impacts on the world; andWHEREAS, Many scientists argue that natural causes such as El Niño, alterations in solar energy, solar wind output, cycles of cosmic ray influx, precipitation microphysics, and changes in cloud forcing—along with human-land-use conversion for cities and agricultural use and deforestation—are much more significant in climate change than CO2 emissions; andWHEREAS, Certain areas of the world, where some say warming is most pronounced, were actually much warmer than they are today, like Greenland, which was extensively farmed by the Vikings from around 1000 to 1300 A.D., before colder temperatures made farming virtually impossible for them; andWHEREAS, Measures to curb global warming, such as those contained in the United Nations-sponsored Kyoto Protocol, are estimated to only reduce the likely rise in the average global temperature by 10 percent or less, from an increase of 2.0o C to 1.9o C by 2100, for example; andWHEREAS, Some estimate that compliance with Kyoto would cost the global economy from about $200 billion to $1 trillion each year without a policy that would allow for global carbon emissions trading and $75 billion each year even with a worldwide trading scheme; andWHEREAS, Large developing countries such as China, India, and Brazil are currently exempt from Kyoto; andWHEREAS, Exempting emerging economies like China, India, and Brazil from CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions reductions would significantly undermine the minute effect on average global temperature gained through reductions by developed nations; and WHEREAS, Forcing developing countries to comply with Kyoto will significantly inhibit their economic development and the development of the international economy; andWHEREAS, Proposed carbon offset programs will have little impact on reducing rising temperatures if human activity is not a significant cause of recent global warming; and WHEREAS, Some are proposing that a maximum acceptable global temperature increase should serve as the guideline for determining reductions in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions; andWHEREAS, Businesses and municipalities will likely pass along the cost of emissions reduction programs to consumers, driving up the cost of goods and services; and WHEREAS, Poor people and underdeveloped regions of the world will be impacted the most severely by higher costs; and WHEREAS, The poor and most vulnerable people around the world are faced with many more quantifiable, immediate, devastating problems; now, therefore, be itRESOLVED, That the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in San Antonio, Texas, June 12-13, 2007, urge Southern Baptists to proceed cautiously in the human-induced global warming debate in light of conflicting scientific research; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we consider proposals to regulate CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions based on a maximum acceptable global temperature goal to be very dangerous, since attempts to meet the goal could lead to a succession of mandates of deeper cuts in emissions, which may have no appreciable effect if humans are not the principal cause of global warming, and could lead to major economic hardships on a worldwide scale; and be it further RESOLVED, That we urge Congress and the president to only support cost-effective measures to reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions and to reject government-mandated reductions in greenhouse gas emissions; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we urge governments to begin to take steps to help protect vulnerable communities and regions from the effects of the inevitable continued cycles of warming and cooling that have occurred throughout geologic history; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we strongly request that all public policy decision makers ensure an appropriate balance between care for the environment, effects on economies, and impacts on the poor when considering programs to reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we support the development of environmental public policy that will improve the stewardship of the earth’s resources without resulting in significant negative consequences not only on the United States and other developed economies, but also, and most importantly, on the poor and on developing economies;

"RESOLUTION NO. 4ON BIBLICAL SEXUALITY AND PUBLIC POLICYWHEREAS, From the beginning, the Bible establishes the basis for sexuality by declaring that human beings are created in God’s image as “male and female” (Genesis 1:26-27) and that “a man leaves his father and mother and bonds with his wife, and they become one flesh” (Genesis 2:24); andWHEREAS, Jesus answered questions about marriage by reaffirming this male/female and “one flesh” creation pattern for sexuality (Matthew 19:4-6); andWHEREAS, The Apostle Paul based his teaching about marriage upon God’s creation order of this one man/one woman relationship and the analogy of Christ and His bride, the Church (Ephesians 5:29-31); andWHEREAS, Any sexual behavior outside of this husband/wife marriage relationship is sinful, including premarital sex, adultery, bestiality, and pornography (Hebrews 13:4; Galatians 5:19; 1 Corinthians 6:9-11; Leviticus 18:23); andWHEREAS, Homosexual behavior is specifically prohibited and condemned in both the Old and New Testaments (Genesis 19:1-27; Leviticus 18:22; Romans 1:18-25; 1 Corinthians 6:9-11); andWHEREAS, Any public policy action normalizing unbiblical sexual behavior or giving homosexual unions the legal status of marriage is diametrically opposed to God’s Word; andWHEREAS, Several state legislatures have voted to redefine marriage, and certain state courts have overturned laws defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman; andWHEREAS, Legislation benignly titled as the “Employment Non-Discrimination Act” (ENDA) would create a specially protected class for homosexuality and other unbiblical lifestyles for employment purposes, preventing many ministries, religiously-based businesses, and employers from honoring their personal religious beliefs in their hiring practices; andWHEREAS, Hate crimes legislation that already has been passed by the United States House of Representatives (HR 1913) would create a special federally-protected class for homosexuality and other unbiblical lifestyles, providing greater protections for crimes committed against them than against many other groups, and criminalizing religious belief and speech about homosexuality and other unbiblical lifestyles; andWHEREAS, Legislation has been introduced (HR 1283) to repeal Section 654 of Title 10 of the United States Code to allow military service personnel to openly engage in homosexual behavior, likely resulting in free speech restrictions, the deterioration of unit cohesion, a weakening of military readiness, forced sensitivity training, and a mass exodus of many fine active service personnel; now, therefore, be itRESOLVED, That the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Louisville, Kentucky, June 23-24, 2009, reaffirm our historic and consistent support of the biblical definition of marriage as the exclusive union of a man and a woman; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we encourage all Christians to be “salt and light” on these issues by exemplifying sexual purity in our lifestyle, speaking prophetically to the culture, and acting redemptively toward individuals; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we once again call on the United States Congress to reject any attempts to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and instead urge passage and ratification of a constitutional amendment protecting the time-honored definition of marriage as exclusively between one man and one woman; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we oppose the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) and any other laws that prevent the exercise of deeply held religious beliefs about homosexuality and other unbiblical lifestyles in hiring practices; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we urge the United States Senate not to pass any hate crimes legislation that would effectively discriminate against non-protected classes in the prosecution of violent crimes or criminalize deeply held religious beliefs and speech about homosexuality and other unbiblical sexual practices; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we support the current military code barring homosexuality in the military and call upon the President, as Commander in Chief, to honor Article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice which precludes homosexual behavior among active service personnel; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we affirm the Southern Baptist Convention Task Force on Ministry to Homosexuals in its effort to call our churches to engage in loving, redemptive ministry to homosexuals; and be it finally RESOLVED, That we proclaim that those who practice any unbiblical sexual behavior can be forgiven and changed, as the Apostle Paul wrote, “…some of you were like this, but you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God” (1 Corinthians 6:9-11).",2009

"WHEREAS, We are, every one of us, sinners against God and, apart from the gospel of Jesus Christ, deserving of only condemnation (Romans 3:23; 6:23); and WHEREAS, The gospel is the good news of salvation that reveals who Jesus is, what He has done, and why it matters (Mark 16:15; Romans 1:16; 5:8; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4); and WHEREAS, Repentance and faith in the finished work of Christ brings believers into right standing with God through the blood and righteousness of Jesus (Mark 1:15; Romans 4:5); and WHEREAS, The power of the gospel transforms believers (Romans 1:16) so that we are able to put sin to death and to pursue holiness (Romans 6:8-22); and WHEREAS, The hope of the gospel assures us of life beyond death through the promise of resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:12; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-14); and WHEREAS, The value of the gospel shows us the relative poverty of the love of money and the pursuit of worldly success (Acts 8:20-22); and WHEREAS, The stewardship of the gospel has been entrusted to us by our Lord Jesus Christ in His Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20; 1 Corinthians 9:16-17); and WHEREAS, The grace of God in the gospel grants salvation to anyone and everyone who believes, regardless of who the person is or what the person has done (Ephesians 2:8-9); and WHEREAS, Apart from the gospel of Jesus Christ, there is no salvation (Acts 4:12); andWHEREAS, The Great Commission Resurgence conversation has prompted Southern Baptists to a heightened awareness of the vast scope of lostness in our communities, across our nation, and around the world; andWHEREAS, Any claim to personal self-righteousness or racial supremacy stands in contradiction to the gospel of free grace in Christ alone (Galatians 2:21; 3:27-28); now, therefore, be it RESOLVED, That the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Orlando, Florida, June 15-16, 2010, call on Southern Baptists to reaffirm our commitment to the supremacy and centrality of the gospel of Jesus Christ in our churches; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we encourage pastors to keep the gospel foremost in every sermon they preach, so that the whole of Scripture and every aspect of life can be seen in the context of how every promise of God finds its “Yes” (2 Corinthians 1:20) in the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; and be it further RESOLVED, That we encourage churches in preaching, teaching, and discipleship to proclaim the gospel to unbelievers, showing them how to find peace with God, and to proclaim the gospel to believers, that through the renewing of our minds we might continually be transformed by the gospel; and be it further RESOLVED, That we urge churches to display the gospel by transcending ethnic, racial, economic, and social barriers due to our unity in Christ; and be it further RESOLVED, That we encourage our churches to celebrate the gospel through the ordinances of baptism and the Lord’s Supper, teaching our congregations the joy of the gospel therein; and be it further RESOLVED, That we recommit ourselves to the glory of the gospel by greater faithfulness to the Great Commission both in personal witness and in sending more gospel workers to the unreached peoples of the world; and be it further RESOLVED, That we urge churches and individual believers to study, identify, and act upon the lostness of their communities, the nation, and the world; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we encourage each church to support its pastor as he leads personally in ongoing Great Commission involvement, both locally and globally; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we commit to speak to the outside world as those who are forgiven sinners, who have received mercy as a free gift, and not as those who are morally or ethically superior to anyone (1 Corinthians 1:27-31; 4:2-7); and be it further RESOLVED, That we seek to live as those who have been rescued by the gospel, evidenced by forgiving our enemies, setting aside personal offenses, crucifying selfish pride, breaking down carnal divisions, and loving one another joyously, counting others as more important than ourselves; and be it finally RESOLVED, That we pray that God would pour out His Spirit to make us truly gospel-centered, gospel-saturated people whose lives and words point the world to our Lord Jesus Christ.",2010
"WHEREAS, The Bible teaches the spiritual discipline of family worship for the glory of God, the strengthening of the church, and the spiritual nourishment of the family (Deuteronomy 6:1-18; Psalm 78:1-8; Ephesians 4-6); andWHEREAS, Scripture pictures the Christian home as a place in which parents are instructed to teach and disciple their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord (Deuteronomy 6:1-18; Ephesians 6:1-4); andWHEREAS, Family worship has been a cherished Southern Baptist principle reflected in church covenants which have called believers “to maintain family and secret devotions” and “to religiously educate” their children; andWHEREAS, In recent years, family worship has been emphasized in The Baptist Faith and Message, which states that “Parents are to teach their children spiritual and moral values and to lead them, through consistent lifestyle example and loving discipline, to make choices based on biblical truth”; andWHEREAS, Southern Baptists have launched major initiatives which have brought to the forefront the need for families to pray, read from the Bible, memorize scripture, and give praise to the Lord within their homes; and WHEREAS, In 2009, the president of the Southern Baptist Convention included family worship as a key catalyst for a Great Commission resurgence calling on Southern Baptists “to build gospel-saturated homes that see children as a gift from God and as our first and primary mission field”; and WHEREAS, Family worship is integral to laying a foundation for multi-generational faithfulness to the gospel (Psalm 145:4) and a necessary complement for the strengthening of the local church to fulfill its commission (Matthew 28:18-20); and WHEREAS, Family worship serves as an important preparation for the corporate worship of the local church on the Lord’s Day (Ephesians 4:11-16; Hebrews 10:25); andWHEREAS, In recent generations, the act of family worship has been neglected, evidenced by the breakdown of the family in our time; and WHEREAS, The embracing of the spiritual discipline of family worship in the Christian home has the capacity to nurture stronger families, a stronger church, and a stronger nation; now, therefore, be itRESOLVED, That the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Orlando, Florida, June 15-16, 2010, encourage churches and families to rekindle the spiritual discipline of family worship; and be it further RESOLVED, That we define family worship as the regular meeting together of a family for a time of prayer and Bible reading, which may include other activities such as scripture memorization, singing spiritual songs and hymns, and discussing biblical truth and Christian mission; and be it further RESOLVED, That we encourage families to cultivate not only structured times of worship together, but also ongoing intentional and informal conversations about the things of the Lord; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That as we call families and churches to embrace family worship, we urge fathers particularly to fulfill their divinely mandated responsibility to lead their families toward spiritual maturity (Ephesians 5:22-6:4; Colossians 3:19-21); and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we encourage all parents to consider times of family worship to be an opportunity to introduce their children to the gospel, to train their children to seek the salvation of their friends and neighbors, and to pray for the nations; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we encourage churches and families to make use of the many resources produced to aid in family worship; and be it finallyRESOLVED, That we urge the churches of the Southern Baptist Convention and their pastors to promote family worship and encourage the families of their congregations to place the highest priority on embracing this foundational spiritual discipline for the well-being of families, the spread of the gospel, the making of disciples, and the glory of God.",2010
"WHEREAS, The Bible reveals that marriage is a gospel mystery, pointing to Christ’s union with His church (Ephesians 5:22-32); andWHEREAS, The Bible teaches that marriage was established by God “in the beginning” to be a permanent one-flesh union (Genesis 2:18-25; Matthew 19:1-9); andWHEREAS, Our Lord Jesus commands us that what “God has joined together, let not man separate” (Mark 10:9); andWHEREAS, The biblical story shows us that one of the lamentable aspects of sin is the destruction of marriages and families, a destruction seen from the Fall until this present darkness; andWHEREAS, The rampant divorce rate in our culture has come with great social and economic cost, with women and children suffering disproportionately in ways that are incalculable; andWHEREAS, We have affirmed in our confession of faith our belief in the sanctity and permanence of marriage; andWHEREAS, Some studies have indicated that conservative Protestants in the United States of America are divorcing at the same rate, if not at higher rates, than the general population; andWHEREAS, Some studies also indicate that areas where Southern Baptist churches predominate in number often have higher divorce rates than areas we would define as “unchurched” and in need of evangelical witness; andWHEREAS, Even the most expansive view of the biblical exceptions allowing for divorce and remarriage would rule out many, if not most, of the divorces in our churches; andWHEREAS, The acceleration in rates of divorce in Southern Baptist churches has not come through a shift in theological conviction about scriptural teaching on divorce but rather through cultural accommodation; andWHEREAS, We have been prophetic in confronting assaults in the outside culture on God’s design for marriage while rarely speaking with the same alarm and force to a scandal that has become all too commonplace in our own churches; andWHEREAS, We do not serve those who are hurting from divorce by speaking to them only in therapeutic terms rather than in terms of both repentance and forgiveness; now, therefore, be itRESOLVED, That the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Orlando, Florida, June 15-16, 2010, acknowledge the complicity of many among us for too often failing to show the world the meaning of the gospel through marital fidelity; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we express our conviction that a denomination defined theologically by our belief in the authority and inerrancy of Holy Scripture ought to proclaim the whole counsel of God, especially when the Bible confronts our own patterns of sin; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we express our further conviction that a denomination defined missiologically ought to recognize how damaging Southern Baptist accommodation to the divorce culture is to our global witness for Christ; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we express our further conviction that a denomination seeking God’s blessing in revival and reformation ought to address the spiritual wreckage left in our Southern Baptist churches by our own divorce rates and our silence about the same; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we call on our churches to proclaim the Word of God on the permanence of marriage, and to provide ongoing marriage enrichment opportunities, in light of the gospel of Jesus Christ and God’s abhorrence of divorce; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we call on our churches to unite in marriage only those who are biblically qualified to be married to one another and who demonstrate an understanding of the meaning of lifelong love and fidelity; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we call on our churches in our wedding services to maintain the gravity of the vows being undertaken, not simply as a token of a couple’s romance but as a covenant before God, until death do them part; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we call on our churches to minister to couples and families in crisis through counseling, mentorship, and, where necessary, through biblical church discipline; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we call on our churches to proclaim God’s mercy and grace to all people—including those who have been divorced without biblical grounds—due to the truth that the blood of Jesus can atone for any sin and can cleanse any conscience; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we call on our churches to have special compassion for and energetic ministry to those who have been left in the wake of family brokenness; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we urge all Southern Baptists in troubled or faltering marriages to seek godly assistance and, where possible, reconciliation; and be it finallyRESOLVED, That we pray that the true peace of our Lord Jesus Christ will reign in us such that the next generation will see the gospel not only in the counter-cultural nature of our verbal witness but also in the counter-cultural love and fidelity of our marriages.",2010
"WHEREAS, On April 20, 2010, the deadly explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in the deaths of eleven workers and touched off an underwater gusher of oil that has spewed millions of gallons of crude petroleum into the waters of the Gulf; andWHEREAS, This crisis is described already as the largest environmental calamity in American history; andWHEREAS, The oil spilling from the ocean’s floor now poses a dire and immediate threat to the coastlands and inland estuaries, marshes, and waterways of the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, and to the eco-systems of birds, shrimp, oysters, fish, and other life-forms; andWHEREAS, Due to the symbiotic relationship between the Gulf of Mexico and the hardworking residents of the Gulf Coast, this crisis jeopardizes an entire way of life for communities, with vast economic, social, cultural, familial, and spiritual consequences; andWHEREAS, Holy Scripture tells us “the earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof” (Psalm 24:1, KJV), and that God’s wisdom and glory is seen in the teeming of life in the seas (Psalm 104:25); andWHEREAS, God has designed us with a dependence on the natural resources around us and has assigned us a dominion of stewardship and protection of those resources for future generations (Genesis 2:7-15); andWHEREAS, Our God-given dominion over the creation is not unlimited, as though we were gods and not creatures, so therefore, all persons and all industries are then accountable to higher standards than to profit alone; andWHEREAS, The Scripture teaches both love of neighbor for those who are suffering (Mark 12:31; Luke 10:25-37; Romans 13:8-10; Galatians 5:14) and accountability for those whose actions harm the vulnerable (Exodus 21:33-22:15; Luke 19:8; Romans 13:1-7); now, therefore, be itRESOLVED, That the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Orlando, Florida, June 15-16, 2010, lament the deaths of the eleven oil rig workers and pray for their families; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we call on Southern Baptist churches and other Christians to pray for the end of this catastrophe and for the homes, lives, cultures, and livelihoods of those in the Gulf Coast region; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we call on the governing authorities to act determinatively and with undeterred resolve to end this crisis; to fortify our coastal defenses; to ensure full corporate accountability for damages, clean-up, and restoration; to ensure that government and private industry are not again caught without planning for such possibilities; and to promote future energy policies based on prudence, conservation, accountability, and safety; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we encourage persons, communities, industries, and governments to work together to find ways to lessen the potentiality of such tragic accidents and of such devastating pollution in order that we may protect what God loves and safeguard the lives, livelihoods, health, and well-being of our neighbors and of future generations; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we call on Southern Baptists to be ready to assist the communities and churches of the Gulf Coast through the clean-up process with the same generosity of spirit that Southern Baptists exhibited after Hurricane Katrina of 2005; and be it finallyRESOLVED, That we acknowledge that this tragedy should remind us to testify to the love of God in His creation and to the hope, through the blood of Christ, of a fully restored creation in which the reign of God is seen “on earth as it is in heaven” (Matthew 6:10).",2010
"WHEREAS, President Obama has promised repeatedly to repeal current law (10USC654) and to change policies that prevent normalizing the open presence of homosexuals in the armed forces; andWHEREAS, The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff has told Congress that he favors normalizing the open presence of homosexuals in the military because he thinks it is morally “the right thing to do”; andWHEREAS, The secretary of defense has told Congress that he will carry out orders to implement normalizing the open presence of homosexuals in the armed forces and has appointed a high level working group to prepare plans for doing so should Congress repeal current law; andWHEREAS, The House of Representatives voted recently to normalize the open practice of homosexuality in the military by authorizing the repeal of current law, and the Senate Armed Services Committee has also passed the repeal language; andWHEREAS, The Defense Department working group tasked with preparing a plan to normalize the open presence of homosexuals in the military must accept input from various sources including advice offered by religious groups such as the Southern Baptist Convention; andWHEREAS, Homosexual behavior cannot be normalized without rejecting God’s moral standards (Leviticus 18:22; 20:13; 1 Corinthians 6:9-10) and is contrary to moral standards held by nearly every civilized order in human history, including most societies in the world today; andWHEREAS, The Bible describes homosexual behavior as both a contributing cause (Genesis 18:20-21; Leviticus 18:24-28; Jude 7) and a consequence of God’s judgment on nations and individuals (Romans 1:18-32); andWHEREAS, Findings in the law passed in 1993 remain true and relevant today including: (1) that “There is no constitutional right” for anyone “to serve in the armed forces,” (2) that “The prohibition against homosexual conduct is a longstanding element of military law that continues to be necessary in the unique circumstances of military service,” and (3) that “The presence in the armed forces of persons who demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability”; andWHEREAS, Defense Department policy remains true and relevant today that states, “the presence in the military environment of persons who engage in homosexual conduct or who, by their statements, demonstrate a propensity to engage in homosexual conduct, seriously impairs the accomplishment of the military mission”; andWHEREAS, Attempting to normalize the open presence of homosexuals in the armed forces while fighting two wars demonstrates willingness to jeopardize national security in favor of the radical agenda advanced by the homosexual lobby, and substitutes a therapeutic ethic (one measuring everything by self-satisfaction) for the sacrificial ethic (one placing duty over personal survival) essential for sustaining national security and social survival; andWHEREAS, Normalizing the open presence of homosexuals in the armed forces will result in pressuring Southern Baptist and other biblically faithful military chaplains to restrict or redefine the gospel message, first by censoring their teaching of the biblical definition of sin, and second by trying to change their beliefs about what is sinful and immoral by requiring them to attend “sensitivity sessions” meant to indoctrinate personnel who resist normalizing openly present homosexuals in all aspects of military life; andWHEREAS, No government should implement standards or policies regulating the lives of military personnel based on nothing other than indulging sexual desires, however strong; andWHEREAS, The United States historically has honored the religious moral freedom of Americans serving in the armed forces, religious moral freedom no government should deny; andWHEREAS, It is the seasoned judgment of most military leaders that normalizing the open presence of homosexuals in the military is incompatible with generating, strengthening, and maintaining good discipline, unit cohesion, and combat readiness; andWHEREAS, Those who would equate the normalizing of homosexuality with the right and just action of President Truman and others to undo racial segregation within the armed services in the mid-twentieth century wrongly confuse the indulgence of immoral behavior with God-given civil rights; andWHEREAS, Military recruiting will be crippled because: (1) those segments of the American population most represented in the armed services are also those segments most likely to have moral convictions against homosexual behavior, (2) a great many of those who have served in the military since 1993 say they would not have served if required to live on intimate terms with open homosexuals, (3) should current law be repealed, a large percentage of currently serving military personnel say they will not reenlist or will end their careers early, and (4) should current law be repealed, many parents will not entrust their sons and daughters to superiors who require them to live on intimate terms with open homosexuals; now, therefore, be itRESOLVED, That the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Orlando, Florida, June 15-16, 2010, affirm the Bible’s declaration that homosexual behavior is intrinsically disordered and sinful, and we also affirm the Bible’s promise of forgiveness, change, and eternal life to all sinners (including those engaged in homosexual sin) who repent of sin and trust in the saving power of Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 6:9-11); and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we oppose changing current law to normalize the open presence of homosexuals in the armed forces, and insist on keeping the finding of Congress that sustains current law, which states that even “the presence in the armed forces” of persons demonstrating “a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts” creates “an unacceptable risk to . . . the essence of military capability”; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That while we oppose normalizing the open presence of homosexuals in the military, we also deplore all acts of violence by anyone for any reason relating to this issue, whether it be violence against homosexuals, or violence by homosexuals; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we express profound pride in and support for all now serving in the United States armed forces, and especially for Southern Baptists and other biblically faithful chaplains serving as ministers of God in the armed forces; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we commend Southern Baptist efforts to engage in loving, redemptive ministry to homosexuals and encourage all Southern Baptists to consider how they might assist those struggling against same-sex attractions to find spiritual, sexual, and emotional wholeness in Christ; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we express appreciation to our servicemen and servicewomen in all branches of the military, who are serving faithfully and honorably both at home and abroad; and be it finallyRESOLVED, That we encourage all Southern Baptists to pray for the safety, well-being, morale, and readiness of our military personnel and to offer prayer, support, and appreciation for the husbands, wives, children, parents, and siblings of our fine service members serving in every capacity of our nation’s military.",2010
"WHEREAS, Southern Baptists historically have supported religious freedom and its related political ideal of a ""free church in a free state,"" and affirm that the First Amendment statement on religion applies to the workplace in the sense that employers and employees should be free from governmental interference or coercion as they freely express matters of religious conviction; andWHEREAS, Scripture speaks of the God-given rights of conscience and the freedom of dissent based on moral and religious principles (Daniel 1:3-17; Acts 4:5-20; 5:17-32); andWHEREAS, Christians face a series of challenges to religious liberty—such as “hate crimes” laws around the world that would criminalize the preaching of the gospel, laws requiring Christian orphan ministries to facilitate adoptions to homosexual couples, the erosion of conscience clauses enabling health care workers to refuse to participate in abortion-related activities, and so forth; andWHEREAS, The right of religious organizations to hire people whose beliefs and conduct are consistent with the principles such organizations espouse is inherent within the constitutional guarantee of religious liberty and was also affirmed in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; andWHEREAS, Congress subsequently strengthened those statutory protections, declaring that any “religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society” could consider the applicants’ religious faith during the hiring process; andWHEREAS, The Supreme Court upheld hiring protections for faith-based organizations in 1987, and Congress has included those protections in numerous federal laws; andWHEREAS, Legislation titled the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) that has been introduced in the House of Representatives (HR 3017, with 202 co-sponsors) as well as in the Senate (S 1584, with 45 co-sponsors) would radically alter the idea of protected classes in American law, granting such things as sexual orientation the same employment protections as gender and race, placing these immoral and aberrant behaviors on the same level as the immutable traits of gender and ancestry; andWHEREAS, ENDA would make it illegal for businesses and organizations with fifteen or more employees to fire or to refuse to hire or promote an employee because of his or her actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity; andWHEREAS, Although recent formulations of ENDA contain a religious exemption that states that churches do not have to hire “homosexual ministers,” they do not contain an exemption for rights of conscience or religious freedom to protect businesses with a religious character (such as religious bookstores, publishers, and parachurch ministries) and other businesses with religious owners or managers; andWHEREAS, Such legislation jeopardizes our First Amendment freedoms by establishing in law the principle that disapproval of homosexual conduct is a form of bigotry, equivalent to racism; andWHEREAS, Homosexual persons are not our enemies but our neighbors whom we love and wish to see find the same forgiveness and freedom we have found in Christ; now, therefore, be itRESOLVED, That the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Orlando, Florida, June 15-16, 2010, express our profound opposition to ENDA and any similar legislation; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we call upon the president of the United States to appoint, and Congress to confirm, only nominees to federal judicial positions who will protect foundational religious freedoms; and be it finallyRESOLVED, That we plead with churches to love all persons, with mercy and grace, regardless of the nature of each person’s sin, and to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, with compassion and conviction, regardless of the laws of the state (Acts 4:18-20).",2010

"WHEREAS, Popular movements calling for greater freedom and democracy are afoot in nations such as Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Pakistan, Iran, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia, the governments of which deny their citizens religious liberty; and WHEREAS, Many others in the Islamic world are denied the right to convert from Islam, because Sharia law makes such conversion a crime subject to penalties as severe as capital punishment; and WHEREAS, Others around the world suffering under totalitarian regimes are denied the right to worship freely; and WHEREAS, The diplomatic, economic, and military engagement of the United States of America in some of these countries brings with it a unique responsibility to promote religious liberty; and WHEREAS, Advocacy for religious liberty is crucial not only abroad but also at home; and WHEREAS, The rapidly changing religious diversity in the United States makes it important to reassert what Baptists have affirmed historically about complete religious liberty for all persons and a free church in a free state; andWHEREAS, This conviction is grounded in the teaching of our Lord Jesus who declared that His Kingdom is “not of this world” (John 18:36), and therefore He has not authorized any earthly realm to advance His Kingdom by the power of the sword; and WHEREAS, The transformation of the heart comes through the action of the Holy Spirit (John 3:3-8), and thus cannot be legislated or forced; andWHEREAS, Efforts to confront spiritual matters with carnal, coercive means are both morally wrong and counter-productive (2 Corinthians 10:4; Ephesians 6:12); now, therefore, be it RESOLVED, That the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Phoenix, Arizona, June 14-15, 2011, restate our long-standing view that religious liberty is an inalienable human right, rooted in the image of God and possessed by all human beings; and be it further RESOLVED, That we affirm that this freedom entails the civil liberty to convert to another religion or to no religion, to seek to persuade others of the claims of one’s religion,  and to worship without harassment or impediment from the state; and be it further RESOLVED, That we oppose the imposition of any system of jurisprudence by which people of different faiths do not enjoy the same legal rights; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we deny that any government should use any coercive measure—including zoning laws or permits—to restrict religious speech or worship, based on the theological content of that speech or worship; and be it further RESOLVED, That we call on the United States government to maintain complete religious liberty for all Americans, as guaranteed in the First Amendment to the Constitution; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we petition our political, diplomatic, and military leaders to make religious liberty for all people a priority in decisions of foreign policy and international aid; and be it finally RESOLVED, That we pray for our brothers and sisters in Christ around the world who are now persecuted, imprisoned, or facing execution for their testimony of faith in Jesus.",2011

"WHEREAS, Rob Bell, in his 2011 book, Love Wins, has called into question the church’s historical teaching on the doctrine of eternal punishment of the unregenerate; andWHEREAS, The church has addressed this issue throughout her history, yet orthodox Christians have affirmed consistently and resoundingly the reality of a literal Hell; andWHEREAS, The Bible clearly teaches that God will judge the lost at the end of the age (Matthew 25:41-46; 2 Peter 2:9; Revelation 20:11-15); andWHEREAS, God must judge the unregenerate because He is a holy God whose judgments are altogether righteous (Psalm 96:10; Romans 2:1-5; Revelation 15:3); andWHEREAS, The Scriptures affirm that this judgment of the unconverted is a judgment unto conscious, eternal suffering apart from the steadfast love and grace of God (Matthew 7:23; 25:46; Luke 16:22-25; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10); andWHEREAS, The Bible precludes the possibility of any opportunity for salvation after death (Hebrews 9:27), urging sinners instead to embrace the glorious gospel today (2 Corinthians 6:2; Hebrews 2:3; 3:13); andWHEREAS, Jesus Christ and the apostles, out of their love for lost people, affirmed the reality of Hell in their own preaching to urge sinners to receive the grace of God, to repent of their sins, and to believe the gospel, and thereby to enter into abundance of eternal life (Matthew 10:28; John 10:10; Acts 17:30-31); andWHEREAS, The prospect of fellow human beings, created in the image of God, spending eternity in Hell grieves us deeply; andWHEREAS, The Scriptures exhort the church to hold fast to and proclaim the “faith once for all delivered to the saints” (Jude 3) and to “guard the good deposit” of truth the Lord has entrusted to us in His Word (1 Timothy 6:20; 2 Timothy 1:14), including difficult truths; andWHEREAS, The Baptist Faith & Message affirms the biblical teaching that “Christ will judge all men in righteousness.

"WHEREAS, For more than a century, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) has been a values-based boys organization designed to “prepare young people for a lifetime of character and leadership,” equipping them “to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law”; andWHEREAS, The Scout Oath contains language that is consistent with belief in God and biblical precepts that serve as the basis for Christian faith: “On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight”; and WHEREAS, The leadership of the Boy Scouts throughout its history has restricted from membership and leadership those persons who would affect the group’s ability to advocate its viewpoints in regard to belief in God and His moral precepts; andWHEREAS, In 1992, and again in 2000, the Southern Baptist Convention adopted resolutions affirming the Boy Scouts in their stand that homosexual conduct is inconsistent with the obligations of the Scout Oath, encouraging the BSA “to maintain its historic commitments” (1992) and “to hold fast to its traditional ideals” (2000); and WHEREAS, The United States Supreme Court ruled in 2000 that the constitutional right to freedom of association allows a private organization, as part of its “expressive message,” to exclude a person from membership when “the presence of that person affects in a significant way the group’s ability to advocate public or private viewpoints” and that allowing homosexuals as adult leaders would interfere with that message (Boy Scouts of America et al. v. Dale); and WHEREAS, In 2004, the Boy Scouts adopted a policy statement that said, in part, “Boy Scouts of America believes that homosexual conduct is inconsistent with the obligations in the Scout Oath and Scout Law to be morally straight and clean in thought, word, and deed”; and WHEREAS, In 2012, an eleven-person committee appointed by the National Council of the Boy Scouts completed a two-year study and reported its unanimous decision that the Boy Scouts retain the current policy as outlined above; and WHEREAS, NBC News reported in breaking news on January 28, 2013, that the BSA executive leadership, in concert with certain members of the BSA board of directors, was poised to change the Scouts’ historic policy at its February 4–5 board meeting the following week to allow avowed homosexuals into membership and leadership positions within the Boy Scouts of America; and WHEREAS, During the week between when news broke of this proposed policy change and the February board meeting, the Boy Scouts received an outpouring of feedback from Scouts, Scouting families, sponsoring organizations, and the American public; andWHEREAS, On February 6, 2013, the BSA board determined that, “due to the complexity of this issue, the organization needs time for a deliberate review of its membership policy”; andWHEREAS, The National Council of the Boy Scouts voted on May 23, 2013, to approve new membership guidelines that state, “no youth may be denied membership in the Boy Scouts of America on the basis of sexual orientation or preference alone”; and WHEREAS, While those who embrace a biblical worldview are grateful that the leadership policy of the BSA remains unchanged, the executive leadership and certain members of the Boy Scouts board clearly signaled their desire to change both the membership and leadership policies of the BSA; andWHEREAS, This decision of the BSA is viewed by many homosexual activists as merely the first step in a process that will fundamentally change the BSA, putting the Scouts at odds with a consistent biblical worldview on matters of human sexuality; and WHEREAS, This decision has the potential to complicate basic understandings of male friendships, needlessly politicize human sexuality, and heighten sexual tensions within the Boy Scouts; andWHEREAS, Many Southern Baptist churches sponsor Boy Scout troops and many Southern Baptists are involved in Scouting; and WHEREAS, The Baptist Faith and Message states that “Christians should oppose . . . all forms of sexual immorality, including adultery, homosexuality, and pornography,” and Southern Baptists consistently have expressed their opposition to the normalization of homosexual behavior in American culture through more than a dozen resolutions over the past thirty years;

and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we express our gratitude for the thousands of individuals within the Scouting family and the culture at large who expressed their opposition to the BSA executive leadership’s intent to change its membership and leadership policies in regard to homosexuality, leading to the compromise recommendation it presented to the BSA National Council; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we express our gratitude to each voting member of the National Council who voted in opposition to the policy change for membership; and be it further RESOLVED, That we express our well-founded concern that the current executive leadership of the BSA, along with certain board members, may utilize this membership policy change as merely the first step toward future approval of homosexual leaders in the Scouts; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we call on the Boy Scouts to remove from executive and board leadership those individuals who, earlier this year, sought to change both the membership and leadership policy of the Scouts without seeking input from the full range of the Scouting family; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we affirm the right of all families and churches prayerfully to assess their continued relationship with the BSA, expressing our support for those churches and families that as a matter of conscience can no longer be part of the Scouting family; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we encourage churches and families that remain in the Boy Scouts to seek to impact as many boys as possible with the life-changing Gospel of Jesus Christ, to work toward the reversal of this new membership policy, and to advocate against any future change in leadership and membership policy that normalizes sexual conduct opposed to the biblical standard; and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we encourage churches that choose to sever ties with the Boy Scouts not to abandon their ministry to boys but consider expanding their Royal Ambassadors ministry, a distinctively Southern Baptist missions organization to develop godly young men; and be it finallyRESOLVED, That we declare our love in Christ for all young people regardless of their perceived sexual orientation, praying that God will bring all youth into a saving knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.",2013

"WHEREAS, Southern Baptists have long been on record in affirming the authority, integrity, sufficiency, and inerrancy of the sixty-six canonical books of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible; and WHEREAS, There is a growing climate in some sectors of evangelical life to deny the historicity, authority, and inerrancy of certain portions of Scripture; and WHEREAS, The Bible reveals the character and nature of our triune God as the one and only covenant-making, covenant-keeping, and saving God in whose presence no other god is able to stand; and WHEREAS, Living in an increasingly pluralistic society places constant pressure on Bible-believing followers of Christ to affirm that all gods are the same and all religions lead to the same God; andWHEREAS, The Bible teaches that every man, woman, and child is a special creation of God, created “in his own image” (Genesis 1:26–27) and indicates, therefore, that “every person of every race possesses full dignity and is worthy of respect and Christian love” (The Baptist Faith and Message, Article III); and WHEREAS, The United Nations High Commission on Refugees estimated in 2017 that more than sixty-five million people worldwide have been forcibly displaced from their homes due to war, violence, disease, extreme poverty, and other conditions; andWHEREAS, The Bible commands followers of Christ to “look after orphans and widows in their distress” (James 1:27) and “defend the rights of the fatherless” (Isaiah 1:17); andWHEREAS, More than six hundred thousand children spend time in the American foster care system each year and more than 150 million children are orphans around the world; now, therefore, be itRESOLVED, That the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Dallas, Texas, June 12–13, 2018, reaffirm our commitment that the Bible alone and the Bible in its entirety “was written by men divinely inspired and is God’s revelation of Himself to man.

Therefore, all Scripture is totally true and trustworthy” (The Baptist Faith and Message, Article I); and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we reaffirm our joyful confidence and unswerving belief that there “is one and only one living and true God” who is “an intelligent, spiritual, and personal Being, the Creator, Redeemer, Preserver, and Ruler of the universe,” who “reveals Himself to us as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, with distinct personal attributes, but without division of nature, essence, or being,” to whom “we owe the highest love, reverence, and obedience” (The Baptist Faith and Message, Article II); and be it furtherRESOLVED, That we continue to “encourage Southern Baptist churches and families to welcome and adopt refugees into their churches and homes as a means to demonstrate to the nations that our God longs for every tribe, tongue, and nation to be welcomed at His throne” (“On Refugee Ministry,” resolution adopted by the Southern Baptist Convention in 2016); and be it finallyRESOLVED, That we call on Southern Baptists to pray specifically whether God is calling them to adopt or foster a child (or children) and encourage local churches to lift up and facilitate adoption and foster care by church members, covering them in prayer and helping them in tangible ways to show the love of Christ to little children, upon whom the Lord Himself showed compassion during His sojourn on earth (Matthew 18:2–6; 19:13–15; Mark 10:13–16; Luke 18:15–17).",2018
